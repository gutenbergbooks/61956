</div>

<p class="noindent">The aim of the present study is to give within
reasonable limits a critical and fairly complete account of the Irish
Monastic Schools which flourished prior to 900&nbsp;<span
class="small">A.D.</span></p>

<p>The period dealt with covering as it does the sixth, seventh, eighth,
and ninth centuries is one of the most obscure in the history of
education. In accordance with established custom writers are wont to
bewail the decline of learning consequent on the Fall of the Roman
Empire in the fifth century and then they pass on rapidly to the
Renaissance in the fifteenth; a few, however, pause to glance at the
Carolingian Revival of learning in the ninth century and to remark
parenthetically that learning was preserved in Ireland and a few
isolated places on the fringe of Roman Civilization, but with some
notable exceptions writers as a class have failed to realise that as in
other departments of human knowledge there is a continuity in the
history of education. The great
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
connecting link between the Renaissance and the Graeco-Roman culture
which flourished in Western Europe during the early centuries of our era
is the Irish Monastic Schools. Modern research clearly points to the
conclusion that the history of these schools is in reality a chapter in
the history of education in Western Europe. While we do not claim that
the Irish schools were the sole factor in the preservation and
transmission of letters during the Early Middle Ages we are certainly
convinced that they played a leading part. The cumulative evidence which
we submit amply warrants this conclusion.</p>

<p>The many tributes of a complimentary nature
which scholars have bestowed on the work of the
Irish Monastic Schools would indicate that the
importance of their influence has not been overlooked;
yet it seems to us that their real aim and
character have not always been clearly understood.
In a certain respect these schools were unique:
they were neither purely classical schools of the
type that flourished in Gaul in the fourth century,
nor were they mere theological seminaries such as
existed in certain parts of Britain and the Continent
that lay outside the Irish sphere of influence. The
peculiar character of the Irish monastic school
would appear to be the result of the harmonious
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
combination of three distinct elements: 1,&nbsp;Native
Irish Culture; 2,&nbsp;Christianity; 3,&nbsp;Graeco-Roman
Culture. We believe that this conception of Irish
monastic culture furnishes the key to a proper
understanding of the real significance of Irish
scholarship during the Early Middle Ages. No
study of Irish monastic schools which neglected to
give due consideration to the potent influence of
each of these three constituents would be adequate
even if it were intelligible. The force of this conviction
which is the result of a prolonged and
critical examination of all the relevant material to
hand has determined the form which the present
study has assumed.</p>

<p>The first and second chapters are not merely introductory: they are
fundamental. In the first chapter we discuss the question of a
pre-Christian and pre-classical native Irish culture. The second chapter
is devoted to an examination of that difficult problem, the beginnings
of classical learning in Ireland—a matter on which modern research has
thrown considerable light. As the school was so intimately connected
with the monastic system it was necessary to devote a special chapter to
an examination of the more salient features of Irish monasticism which
differed in many ways from Continental monasticism. Here we are <span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> impressed with the fact
that the native Irish ideals blended with those of Christianity so as to
give the Irish monastic life a peculiarly national character which was
ever reflected in the educational aims and ideals of the Irish monk even
when his missionary zeal carried him far from the environment of his
native land. In the fourth chapter the attempt is made to determine the
precise relation which existed between the Irish monastic school and the
general educational situation not only in Ireland and Britain but in
Western Europe from 650 to 900&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>
Those three great centres of intellectual life in every Irish
monastery—the school room, the scriptorium and the library—are treated
in the fifth chapter. The particular function of each and its relation
to the others is described while their combined influence, whether of a
contemporary or permanent nature, has been noticed. The all-important
question of the nature of the curriculum has been critically examined in
the sixth chapter. Finally, a chapter is given to a discussion of the
scope of Irish scholarship and its significance in Mediæval Culture.</p>

<p>While a work of this nature can scarcely claim to
be original and the acknowledgments are too
numerous to recount, yet the grouping is new and
not unfrequently facts have been presented from a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
new angle. Source material has been consulted
where possible. The results of previous investigation
have been freely used, but even as often
happened when we have arrived at conclusions
which have been anticipated by other writers, we
have maintained quite as critical and independent
an attitude as when we ventured to challenge
certain popular opinions and to make such
generalizations as the result of our own study
seemed to warrant. In some instances, however,
this study has carried us into fields of inquiry where
we have no credentials, but in these cases as in
every other where we have used secondary authorities
acknowledgment is always made in the foot-notes.</p>

<p>In various ways we have endeavoured to condense
a good deal of information into a limited
space. For example, to avoid repetition we give
frequent cross references to important topics dealt
with in different parts of this study. Again,
instead of attempting the bewildering and impossible
task of giving an account of individual schools
we have given a list of the more important ones and
merely referred to particular schools as occasion
demanded in order to illustrate certain points of
primary importance. For similar reasons all
attempts at biographical accounts of Irish scholars
have been studiously avoided. Such references
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
as have occasionally been made were necessary in
carrying out our general plan which was to deal
with the Irish monastic school as an educational
institution. Of course it would have served no
useful purpose to ignore completely those men
whose acknowledged scholarship was the best testimony
of the character of the instruction available
in the schools in which they themselves studied and
taught.</p>

<p>A word might be said with reference to the proportion
of space occupied by the different topics.
The plan invariably followed has been to give a
minimum of space to any topic which is treated
fairly fully elsewhere in some accessible work. On
the other hand no topic which appeared to be an
integral part of the general plan has been omitted
and such topics as have been inadequately treated
elsewhere have here received fuller consideration.</p>

<p>While quite conscious of the limitations of our
treatment, it is hoped that by pointing out many
supplementary sources of information we have done
something to smooth the path of other investigators
who may wish to explore those portions of the same
field which lay outside the scope of our present
inquiry.</p>

<p>The author wishes to express his sincere thanks to
the following: to Dr. Fletcher H. Swift, Professor
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
of the History of Education in the University of
Minnesota, for his sympathetic interest in the subject
and for his advice and guidance; to Rev.
Laurence P. Murray, <span class="smcap">M.R.I.A.</span>, Principal of St.
Brigid’s Irish College, Omeath, Co. Louth, for the
use of his excellent Irish library and for helpful
suggestions and criticisms of the earlier chapters;
to Rev. Dr. Peter Guilday, Professor of History
in the Catholic University of Washington, D.C., for
reading the MS. and for his advice and encouragement;
to Mr. Patrick O’Daly of the Talbot Press
for seeing the work through the press and for painstaking
proof-reading; and finally to the publishers
for turning out the work in an attractive and
scholarly form.</p>

<p class="subtitle2">CIVILIZATION AND LEARNING IN IRELAND IN<br />
PAGAN TIMES</p>

<p class="noindent">The precise state of civilization and learning in
Ireland in pre-Christian times is difficult to determine owing to the
fact that there is no native contemporary evidence of a documentary
nature, while the references in the works of foreign writers are few in
number and generally vague in character. Fortunately, however, there are
a few sources of information which have been made available by the
laborious and scholarly researches of generations of investigators. The
principal of these sources are:</p>

<ol class="sources">
<li>Archæology.</li>
<li>The so-called Brehon Laws.</li>
<li>Early Irish Literature.</li>
<li>Foreign Testimony.</li>
<li>Ogam Inscriptions.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>A brief survey of the evidence supplied by each of these may be
helpful in determining the nature and extent of Irish pagan culture.</p>


<h3>ARCHÆOLOGICAL EVIDENCE:</h3>

<p>Archæological research shows that Ireland was
inhabited from very early times though it is impossible
to fix the exact chronological limit of the
earliest colonization. Passing over the beginnings
of civilization which are exemplified by the crude
implements and other remains of the Stone Age, we
note that in the Bronze Age when the art of working
metals had been discovered the existing specimens
of the work of these ancient craftsmen point
to a relatively advanced stage of civilization.
Indeed, an examination of the discoveries of this
period amply justifies the statement that “in point
of wealth, artistic feeling and workmanship, the
Irish craftsmen of the Bronze Age surpassed those
of Britain.”<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The doyen of prehistoric chronology,
Dr. Oscar Montelius of Stockholm, having studied
the antiquities of the British Isles, gave the result
of his labours in a memoir published in 1918.<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This
work is now the standard authority on this subject.
Dr. Montelius divides the Bronze Age into five
periods. In the first period he includes the
Transitional Period where copper was in use
(Copper period) which he places between the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
middle of the third and the beginning of the second
millenium, <span class="small">B.C.</span> One of the greatest living Irish
archæologists, Mr. George Coffey, while agreeing
with the Scandinavian as to the division into five
periods, would not place the first period so early
as has been suggested by Dr. Montelius, but agrees
that the first period ended between 2000&nbsp;<span class="small">B.C.</span>
and 1800&nbsp;<span class="small">B.C.</span> Both writers would place the end
of the fifth period, that is, the end of the Bronze
Age about 350&nbsp;<span class="small">B.C.</span> Thus we may consider the
Irish Bronze Age as extending approximately from
2000&nbsp;<span class="small">B.C.</span> to 350&nbsp;<span class="small">B.C.</span>
Mr. Coffey in one of his
valuable works gives numerous illustrations representative
of each period.<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The originals are nearly
all in the National Museum, Dublin, where Mr.
Coffey is the official Keeper of Irish Antiquities.
A notable feature of the finds of this period is the
abundance and variety of the gold ornaments. The
collection of gold ornaments of Irish workmanship
is the largest in the British Isles being twelve or
thirteen times more than that in the British
Museum.<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Possibly, this is but a small fraction of
the entire output of the Irish artists of pagan
times; for many Irish gold ornaments have been
discovered in Scandinavia and in Western Europe
not to speak of many finds which never enter a
museum.<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>From such material remains it would appear to
be a legitimate deduction that even at this early
age the Irish were skilled craftsmen and acquired
by some means at least an elementary and industrial
and technical education and that they were
already cultivating the æsthetic. Art was developing
on distinctly national lines, yet the country was
not isolated. There must have been direct communication
with the Continent; for Mr. Coffey has
traced Aegean and Scandinavian influence in the
incised ornament of the New Grange group<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and
Iberian influence on some of the later type of
bronze ornaments.<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<h3>THE BREHON LAWS:</h3>

<p>The laws of a country dealing as they do with
man in his relations to his fellow-man and society
in general are always an important indication of the
state of civilization attained by the race which has
evolved them. In this connection a valuable source
of information on the social condition and state of
culture attained by the pagan Irish is the native
code of laws, generally styled the Brehon Laws,
but more correctly termed the <i>Féineachas</i>.
According to a generally accepted tradition these
laws were revised and codified in 438&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> by a
committee of nine appointed by King Laoghaire at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the suggestion of St.&nbsp;Patrick. The committee
consisted of three kings (Laoghaire, High King of
Ireland; Corc, King of Munster; and Daire, King
of Cairnach); three saints (St.&nbsp;Patrick, himself,
St.&nbsp;Benin and St.&nbsp;Cairnech); and three learned men
(Ross, Dubhthach and Feargus).<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> These laws
grew up with the people from the very beginning
of society and took cognisance of them from every
point of view. They professed to regulate domestic
and social relations of every kind, as well
as professions, trades, industries, occupations and
wages.<a id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> As laws they are too minute; but this
defect renders them valuable to the student who is
interested in the social conditions of the period
during which they were evolved. As a recent
commentator<a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> has remarked: “The rigorously
authentic character of these laws relating to, and
dealing with the actual realities of life and with
institutions and a state of society nowhere else
revealed to the same extent; the extreme antiquity
both of the provisions and the language in which
they were written, and the meagreness of Continental
material illustrative of the same things
endow them with exceptional archaic, archæological
and philological interest.” The development
of such a comprehensive and detailed code
of laws must have been the work of many generations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
of lawmakers and suggest a relatively high
degree of native culture. In this connection one
is inclined to quote the emphatic declaration of Dr.
George Sigerson who has won honours both as a
litterateur and as a scientist. He says: “I assert
that, biologically speaking, such laws could not
emanate from any race whose brains had not been
subject to the quickening influence of education for
many generations.”<a id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> In other words, such a code
of laws can be accounted for only on the assumption
of a high degree of culture as a racial heritage of
the nation which evolved them.</p>

<h3>EVIDENCE FROM EARLY IRISH LITERATURE:</h3>

<p>There are many passages in the oldest Irish
literature, both secular and religious, which state
that the Irish had books before the introduction of
Christianity. In a memoir<a id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> of St.&nbsp;Patrick written
in the seventh century Muirchu Maccu Machteni
relates how during the contest of the saint with the
druids—the learned men of the time—the High
King Laoghaire proposed that one of St.&nbsp;Patrick’s
books and one belonging to the druids should be
cast into the water to see which would come out
uninjured—a kind of ordeal. Here it will be
noticed that Muirchu’s statement embodies a tradition
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
which was old in the seventh century. The
same story is told in the <i>Tripartite Life of St.
Patrick</i>.<a id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Both the Irish bardic tales and the
oldest existing lives of St.&nbsp;Patrick agree in stating
that he found in the country both literary and professional
men—all pagans—druids, poets and
antiquarians or historians,<a id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> as well as an elaborate
code of laws.<a id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Although no Irish document has been preserved
which dates earlier than the seventh century, there
is ample intrinsic evidence that the earliest existing
documents were copied from manuscripts which
go back a century or two earlier and these again
may have recorded the traditions of a still earlier
period. Authorities are agreed that after the
establishment of Christianity in the fifth century
the Irish scholars committed to writing not only the
laws, bardic historical poems, &amp;c. of their own
time, but those which had been preserved
from earlier times whether traditionally or otherwise.<a id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
In a subsequent chapter reference will be
made to a common practice of the Irish monks,
namely that of making marginal and interlinear
glosses on the classical writings they were studying,
copying, or teaching. For the present it is sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
to note that even in the case of the earliest
of the seventh century glosses the written language
was fully developed and cultivated, with a polished
phraseology and an elaborate and systematic
grammar having well established forms for its words
and for all its rich inflections. To the linguistic
student it is inconceivable how much a complete
and regular system of writing could have developed
in the period which had elapsed from the introduction
of Christianity in the fifth century until the
general spread of Christian learning in the seventh.
Such a period would be much too short, especially
when it is recollected that early Irish literature had
its roots not in Christianity but in the native learning
which was the main, and almost the sole,
influence in developing it. This consideration
points clearly to the conclusion that native learning
was carefully and systematically cultivated before
the introduction of Christianity.</p>

<p>Again, Irish poetry owes its development solely
to the Lay Schools.<a id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> It had complicated prosody—with
numerous technical terms<a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> all derived from
the Irish language. These vernacular terms used
in Irish grammar contrast strikingly with the terms
used to designate the offices and ceremonies of
Christianity which were almost all derived from
Latin.<a id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> All this would go to prove that Irish
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
prosodial rules and technical terms, and of course
Irish poetry itself, were fully developed before the
introduction of Christianity.</p>

<h3>FOREIGN TESTIMONY:</h3>

<p>At least one foreign writer bears witness of the
fact that the pagan Irish possessed books. A
Christian philosopher of the fourth century (some
would place him as early as the second or third)
whose name is Aethicus of Istria wrote a Cosmography
of the World in which he states that on
leaving Spain he hastened to Ireland where he spent
some time “examining their books” (<i>eorum
volumina volvens</i>).<a id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Aethicus is not by any means
complimentary. He calls the Irish sages unskilled
and uncultivated teachers, but he speaks of the
Spaniards in a similar strain. Possibly not understanding
the Irish language he regarded all learning
outside of Greece and Rome as barbarous and
beneath notice. However, his statement proves
that when he visited Ireland there were books at
least a century before St.&nbsp;Patrick’s advent; it also
shows that he found them in such abundance that
he spent some time in examining them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<h3>OGAM INSCRIPTIONS:</h3>

<p>The point has now been reached when it is
necessary to discuss the kind of writing used in
pagan times. As has been stated, none of the
books of pre-Christian Ireland are now extant, so
evidence as to the kind of writing in use must be
sought elsewhere. In the absence of books the
coinage of a country has often given valuable
information in this connection. In the case of
Ireland, however, this source of information is
lacking; for though metals were worked from very
early times and gold was plentiful no trace of a
native coinage has been found. Luckily there
remain in the stone inscriptions the clearest proofs
that the ancient Irish practised a peculiar kind of
writing called Ogam.</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF OGAM:</h3>

<p>Ogam or Ogham was a species of writing the letters of which were a
combination of short lines and points on, and at both sides of, a middle
or stem line called a <i>flesc</i>. In the specimens still remaining
this Ogam writing is almost entirely confined to stone inscriptions, the
groups of lines and points running along two adjacent sides of a stone
with the angular edge for the <i>flesc</i>. The arrangement may be
understood from a simple diagram.<a id="FNanchor_21"></a><a
href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="noborder" alt="The Ogham Alphabet" width="700"
src="images/ogham.jpg" />
</div>


<p>The above diagram shows the Ogam alphabet
arranged in four groups. A few other characters
are occasionally used. It will be noted that crude
as this device for writing is, it is applied with considerable
skill and is framed with much ingenuity.
The simpler sounds are represented by simpler
letters than the more complex. Letters in frequent
use like the vowels are the easiest to form. The
arrangement of the vowels is different from that
used in the Latin and English alphabets but corresponds
to the more scientific arrangement
adopted by modern phoneticians. It is worth
noting that the characters in group (ii) stand for the
initial sounds of the Old Irish words for <i>one</i>, <i>two</i>,
<i>three</i>, <i>four</i>, <i>five</i>, in the order given.</p>

<p>The question of Ogam writing has occupied the
attention of many antiquarians and though some of
the theories projected by the earlier investigators
have been rejected as untenable our knowledge of
Ogam at the present time is fairly definite but
somewhat limited. It was once thought that Ogam
was a cryptic alphabet, but many of the inscriptions
have been read by means of the above key which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
is to be found in the Book of Ballymote. Owing
to the fact that a few of the later Ogams have been
found with duplicates in Roman letters they have
been deciphered independently. As to the distribution
of these Ogam inscribed stones it is worthy
of note that in Ireland they are found chiefly in the
south-west, and in Britain they are confined to
those parts where it is known the Irish Gael had
settled.<a id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Owing to the lack of criteria for dating
certain sound-changes in the Irish language it is
impossible in the present stage of our knowledge
to assign definite chronological limits to these
Ogam inscriptions.<a id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Mr. Quiggin in his account
of Ogam<a id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> asserts that the earlier inscriptions cannot
be later than the fifth century and if pagan
they may be a century or two earlier. All Ogam
inscriptions with accompanying Roman letters he
would assign to a later period than 500&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> with
the sole exception of the bilingual inscription of
Killen Cormac (Cillin Cormac) which is believed
to be earlier than 500&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span><a id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Over three hundred
Ogam inscriptions have been found and where they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
have not been injured or defaced they can generally
be interpreted.</p>

<p>Heroes and druids in the older epics are represented
as making constant use of Ogam letters,
sometimes inscribing them on wooden staves. The
state of civilization depicted in these ancient poems
and prose narratives seems to belong mainly to pre-Christian
Ireland.</p>

<p>There is some difference in opinion as to the
means whereby the Irish discovered the use of
letters. One thing is certain, the Ogam alphabet
is based on the Latin alphabet. Some think that the
Irish first became acquainted with the Roman
alphabet through direct trade with the Continent,
but it is more probable as MacNeill has shown<a id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> that
this knowledge was acquired from the Romanized
Britons from the first or second century onward.
But how or why they invented the Ogam alphabet
instead of using the Roman letters, or else Greek
ones like the Gauls, is a profound mystery. There
can, however, be no doubt that the Ogam alphabet
at whatever time invented, is the peculiar possession
of the Irish Gael and is to be found only where
he had his settlements.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY:</h3>

<p>From the preceding discussion we may safely
conclude:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>1. That long before the Christian era the Ancient
Irish had developed many useful arts and were
skilled and artistic craftsmen.</p>

<p>2. That they had a code of laws that was well
suited to the state of society that then existed, and
that with slight alterations it was well adapted to
meet the requirements of the higher civilization of
Christianity. (A corroboration of this view is the
well-known fact that at a much later date many of
the Anglo-Norman settlers abandoned their own
code of laws and adopted the Brehon Code to which
they became as much attached as the Irish themselves).</p>

<p>3. That native learning was actively cultivated
and systematically developed before the introduction
of Christianity.</p>

<p>4. That there was a learned class called druids
who were the priests, teachers, poets, historians
and judges. (The same man in early times combined
in himself all these functions, but in later times
there was a tendency to specialize).</p>

<p>5. That the Pagan Irish had a knowledge of
letters and that they wrote their learning or part
of it in books and cut Ogam inscriptions on stone
and wood, but how they obtained this knowledge
we have no certain means of determining.</p>

<p class="subtitle2">THE BEGINNINGS OF CLASSICAL LEARNING</p>

<p class="noindent">Hitherto our study has been limited to a discussion
of native Irish culture influenced but slightly from the outside. Here
the attempt is made to trace the beginnings of classical learning. In
this connection it is worth noting that Ireland occupies the unique
position of being the only part of the Celtic world that was not brought
under the sway of Roman arms. The consequence is that she is one of the
very few nations of Western Europe whose civilization was free to
develop along native lines. Yet it must not be supposed that Ireland
remained completely aloof from the Graeco-Roman culture to which the
world owes so much.<a id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27"
class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The great difference between Ireland and the
other Celtic countries such as Britain and Gaul lies in this: in Gaul
the combined forces of Roman arms and Roman culture wiped out almost
every trace of native culture, the same is true of the greater part of
Britain.<a id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28"
class="fnanchor">[28]</a> In Ireland, on the other hand,
Roman <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> learning
was introduced in a peaceful manner (at least as early as the fifth
century, as will be shown later). Now as we have seen native learning
was already developing along national lines, the result was that not
only did the native learning continue to flourish unchecked by the
arrival of the new learning but the former actually received a fresh
impulse,<a id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29"
class="fnanchor">[29]</a> while classical learning was cultivated to an
extent that is without parallel in contemporary
Europe.<a id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30"
class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The precise way in which letters reached Ireland
and the causes which led to “that remarkable outburst
of classical learning towards the close of the
sixth century”<a id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> are matters on which most writers
express themselves vaguely, or assume that certain
ill-defined influences emanating from Britain or
Gaul somehow reached her shores, but at what
time or by what means they have not been able to
determine.</p>

<p>The introduction of classical learning as well as
of Christianity is popularly ascribed to St.&nbsp;Patrick
whose missionary work began 432&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> This
opinion though widespread will not stand a critical
examination. It is true, however, that St.&nbsp;Patrick
is the first person whose name is associated with
the introduction of classical learning of whom it can
be said that the writings ascribed to him are really
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
his. In the <i>Book of Armagh</i> (completed c. 806
<span class="small">A.D.</span>) there is a document called his “Confession,”
or apology which was copied by the scribe Torbach
from the original.<a id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Although the “Confession”
and other writings attributed to St.&nbsp;Patrick may be
admitted as genuine, it must not be assumed that
the learning for which Ireland became famous
during the sixth, seventh and eighth centuries could
have been the result of his labours.<a id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Most people
who have read St.&nbsp;Patrick’s writings will admit that
he makes no claim to be a scholar but on the contrary
he has a very humble opinion of himself and
reminds us frequently of his ignorance of letters.
As Bury says,<a id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> “His Latin is as ‘rustic’ as the
Greek of St.&nbsp;Mark and St.&nbsp;Matthew,” and
Whitley Stokes infers from his writings that he
knew no Greek.<span class="nlbr"><a id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span> In this respect St.&nbsp;Patrick was
no worse than many of his famous contemporaries
and successors, for example—his Latin is no more
‘rustic’ than that of Gregory of Tours who lived
a century later. Indeed St.&nbsp;Patrick’s claim to
fame rests on higher grounds than those of classical
scholarship. He was a preacher and organizer
rather than a man of letters. He was a <i>homo unius
libri</i> but with that book, the Christian Scriptures,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
he was extraordinarily familiar.<a id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Yet some writers
have attributed the introduction of learning and
even of the Roman alphabet to St.&nbsp;Patrick. It is
true that in the <i>Tripartite Life</i> there are frequent
statements that he wrote <i>Abgitoria</i> (usually translated
Alphabets) for his noble or bardic converts.<a id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
It is very probable that these do not mean alphabets,
as is usually supposed, like that on the pillar stone
of Kilmakedar in Kerry,<a id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> but <i>elementa</i>, the A B C
of the Christian Doctrine. This explanation seems
justified by the words <i>Abgitir Crabaid</i> glossed
<i>initium fidei</i> in a Würzburg MS.<a id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In the Tripartite
occur the words, <i>Aibgitir in Crabaid</i>—translated
the Alphabet of Piety—where a specimen is given
of a work so entitled.<a id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> For these and other
reasons which will be stated presently the weight
of evidence is against attributing to St.&nbsp;Patrick the
introduction of the Roman alphabet or any liberal
measure of classical learning.</p>

<p>It has also been suggested<a id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> that some of the
Britons or Gauls who accompanied St.&nbsp;Patrick
brought these studies to Ireland, but Meyer thinks
this most improbable and dismisses the idea that
any missionaries whether Gallic or British introduced
classical learning into Ireland. The origin
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
of that deep culture embracing not only the classical
authors but also grammar, metrics, and other
sciences such as astronomy he would attribute to
a much broader and deeper influence.<a id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Basing his argument on a document found
among Zimmer’s papers, Meyer contends that the
seeds of classical learning were sown in Ireland
during the first and second decades of the fifth
century by Gallic scholars who fled their own
country owing to the invasion of the latter by the
Goths and other barbarians.<a id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The same explanation
seems to have occurred to De Jubainville, for
he says: “La culture des lettres classiques et latins
a cessé en Gaule depuis la conquête germanique au
cinquième siècle; <i>l’Irlande</i> qu’à cette époque n’a
pas encore envahie les barbares des contrées
situées à nord-ouest de la Gaule, <i>paraît avoir donné
asile aux hommes d’étude chassés de la Gaule</i> par
les armes et la domination sauvage des Burgundes,
des Wisigoths et des Francs.”<a id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> To Meyer, however,
we owe the development of this theory. He
quotes from a sixth century entry in a Leyden MS.
This note states that owing to a barbarian invasion
“all the learned men fled from Gaul, and in transmarine
parts, <i>i.e.</i> in Ireland and wherever they
betook themselves, brought about a great advancement
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of learning to the inhabitants of these
regions.”<a id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> This theory is supported by a passage
in St.&nbsp;Patrick’s “Confession”<a id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> where
evidently replying to the attacks of certain rhetoricians
who were hostile to him, the saint exclaims:
“You rhetoricians who know not the Lord hear
and search who it was that called me up, fool
though I be, from the midst of those who call themselves
wise and skilled in the law and mighty orators
and powerful in everything.”<a id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Meyer maintains
that the reference is to the pagan rhetoricians from
Gaul whose arrogant presumption founded on their
own learning made them regard with disdain the
illiterate apostle of the Scots. His few and forcible
epithets well describe the type of rhetorician common
in Gaul.</p>

<p>If Meyer’s theory is correct, and it seems the
most tenable that has been advanced, then we may
conclude that Ireland derived her classical learning
from Gaul when Gallic scholarship was at its best.
This would explain the excellence of the Latin and
the acquaintance with Greek which, as we shall
show, was exhibited by the Irish scholars who
visited the Continent from the time of Columbanus
(543–615) to that of Johannes Scottus Eriugena
(c. 810–c. 875).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>The more one examines this subject the more he
is inclined to accept this theory which gets over
the difficulty of assuming that the Irish obtained
their classical learning from Britain where as
Zimmer has shown there was not any classical
learning wide and profound enough to produce
such results;<a id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> nor were the High Schools of Gaul
a quiet place for learning in the fifth century<a id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
though Colgan would have us believe—we know
not on what authority—that St.&nbsp;Patrick sent St.
Olcan to Gaul to study sacred and profane learning
so that he might return to Ireland to establish
“publicas scholas.”<a id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>There is nothing improbable in supposing that
these rhetoricians should flee to Ireland for safety
just as refugee Christians fled to the same island from
the persecutions of the Emperor Diocletian more
than a century before St.&nbsp;Patrick’s time.<a id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Indeed
Ireland was well known to Roman geographers,
though their ideas of its location were rather inaccurate.
Tacitus informs us that Ireland is
situated between Spain and Britain,<a id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> a conception
which points to direct communication with the
Empire. The same author further informs us that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the harbours of Ireland were well known to merchants
through trade and commerce.<a id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> As the
researches of Mr. George Coffey and Mrs. Greene
have shown, intercourse and commerce between
Ireland and Gaul had been constant and regular for
centuries before the fifth.<a id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> There were even
Gallic mercenaries in the service of Irish kings
during the early centuries of our era.<a id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Moreover,
Irishmen at this time were familiar figures on
the Continent. Amongst these may be mentioned
Mansuetus, Bishop of Toul about 350&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span><a id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> There
can be little doubt that Sedulius, the great Christian
poet, author of <i>Carmen Pascale</i>, was an Irishman.<a id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Sedulius, sometimes called Sedulius the Elder (to
distinguish him from another Sedulius who was at
Compostella in the eighth century and still another
Sedulius who was at Liège in the ninth), flourished
between 423–450&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span><a id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> His work treating of the
chief events recorded in the Old and New Testament
was “the first Christian Epic worthy of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
name.”<a id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Dr. Sigerson by a scholarly analysis<a id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
of the verse structure traces the influence of the
Irish school of prosody referred to in the previous
chapter. Though Sedulius wrote in Latin and
followed the classical forms of verse, yet he infused
into them certain characteristics of Irish poetry,
such as systematic alliteration, assonance and
rhyme—qualities that reveal the Gael.</p>

<p>Ireland is also credited with the doubtful honour
of having given birth to Pelagius and his associate
Caelestius.<a id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Both flourished in the beginning of
the fifth century. Zimmer contended that Pelagius
was an Irishman,<a id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> but Healy shows that he was a
British monk of Irish origin.<a id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Healy also
endeavours to prove that the assumption that
Caelestius was an Irishman is based on a misconception.<a id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Against this view we must place Meyer’s
opinion. The latter asserts that whether Pelagius
was an Irishman or not “his faithful henchman,
Caelestius, he of the plausible tongue, certainly
was.”<a id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The weight of evidence seems to point to
the conclusion that one or other, if not both, of
these heresiarchs was Irish or at least of Irish
descent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Enough was written to show that some Irish
families at least were in reach of a classical literary
education and were prompt to grasp it even before
the middle of the fifth century.<a id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Hence we cannot
attribute the introduction of classical learning
to St.&nbsp;Patrick as has been so often asserted. Nor
can we attribute to St.&nbsp;Patrick the introduction of
Christianity itself. According to Zimmer there
were missionaries at work in the third century in the
southern part of Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> It would seem, however,
that Zimmer makes too sweeping a statement
when he says that Ireland was a Christian land
before the fifth century; for, as MacCaffery has
pointed out, the Irish Hero Tales which were taken
down about the beginning of the eighth century
represent the life of the first, second and third
centuries and paint the social life as unaffected by
Christianity.<a id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>That there were some Christians in Ireland before
the time of St.&nbsp;Patrick there can be no doubt. Bede
distinctly states that Palladius, the predecessor of
St.&nbsp;Patrick, was sent by Pope Celestine to the Irish
who believed in Christ—“<i>ad Scottos in Christum
credentes</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Here it should be pointed out that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the word <i>Scoti</i> or <i>Scotti</i> wherever it occurs in writings
prior to the tenth century means the <i>Irish</i>, and
the Irish alone, the inhabitants of Scotia Major
(Ireland). Later the term was extended to include
the Irish colony in North Britain (Scotia Minor).
Eventually the name was still further extended to
include the inhabitants of the whole country now
called Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>It has been necessary to go into some detail in
order to refute a popular fallacy that it was due to
the labours of St.&nbsp;Patrick that Ireland owes the
introduction of Christianity as well as the beginnings
of classical learning. However, as Professor Bury
points out, the fact that the foundations of
Christianity had been laid sporadically in certain
parts of Ireland does not deprive St.&nbsp;Patrick’s
mission of its eminent significance. He did three
things: he organised the Christianity which
already existed; he converted many districts which
were still pagan, especially in the West; he brought
Ireland into connection with the Church of the
Empire and made it formally a part of universal
Christendom.<a id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> While as has been shown he did
not introduce classical learning, his indirect influence
must have been considerable. The very fact that
Latin was the ecclesiastical language of the new
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
religion gave it an importance and a dignity.
Besides St.&nbsp;Patrick and his fellow workers would
naturally help to diffuse a knowledge of ecclesiastical
Latin at least in every part of the island
which Christianity reached,<a id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> but it must be remembered
that Ireland was not a completely Christian
land even at his death.<a id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Paganism still lingered
in many parts and its influence can be traced in the
early native literature,<a id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and even in the early Lives
of the Irish Saints.<a id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> To complete the work which
he did so much to promote as well as to supply the
spiritual wants of the converted, a native ministry
was essential. In order to equip such a ministry
Christian schools had to be established. Unable
to give proper attention to the instruction of these
ecclesiastical students, St.&nbsp;Patrick after about
twenty years’ peripatetic teaching established
c. 450&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> a school at Armagh of which St.&nbsp;Benin
or Benignus was given charge. The primary aim
of this school was to train subjects for the priesthood.<a id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
A knowledge of Latin and perhaps Greek
were acquired. To supply the various churches
with books there was a special house in which
students were employed as scribes.<a id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>From what has been said about the presence of
Gallic scholars in Ireland we may infer that there
were classical schools in existence in certain localities,
but in the foundation of the School of Armagh
we have the first recorded attempt at the organization
of instruction in Christian theology and
classical learning in Ireland. We append a list of
other schools which the most reliable authorities
ascribe to the latter half of the fifth century. It is
doubtful whether these were really monastic schools
at first for reasons that will be given in the next
chapter. It is more likely that they were ecclesiastical
seminaries during the time of the First Order
of Saints (c. 440–534&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The significance of these fifth century schools
from the point of view of the present study lies in
the fact that they were the precursors of the great
monastic schools which sprang up in such numbers
in the sixth century. We have good reason for
believing that it was in these early schools and by
the labours of Gallic scholars and their pupils that
the foundations were laid of that classical scholarship
that drew the eyes of Europe upon Ireland
during the sixth, seventh and eighth and ninth
centuries.</p>

<p class="subtitle2">IRISH MONASTICISM</p>

<p>As the organization of the Irish monastic schools
was so intimately connected with the Irish monastic
system it is impossible to form a clear idea of the
character, aims, curriculum, or the scope of scholarship
of these schools without some reference to
Irish monasticism and its relation to other types of
monasticism.</p>

<p>Monasticism in general is a system of living that
owes its origin to those tendencies of human nature
which are summed up in the words mysticism and
asceticism. Mysticism may be defined as the
efforts to give effect to the craving for union with
the Deity even in this life; and asceticism, as the
effort to give effect to the hankering after an ever
progressive purification of the soul, and an atoning
for sin by the renunciation and self-denial of things
lawful.<a id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> These two tendencies would appear to be
inseparable from humanity, because though not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
always called into activity, they are always liable to
be invoked, and in all ages and among all peoples
they have frequently asserted themselves.<a id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> In one
form or another monasticism had appealed to people
of various countries long before it became associated
with Christianity. In the early years of Christianity
monasticism took a definite shape in Syria, Egypt
and Armenia. From Egypt and Syria it was
brought to Rome about the middle of the fourth
century by Athanasius, the great champion of the
Divinity of Christ; by Honorius, the founder of the
island monastery of Lerins; and by Cassian whose
“Institutes” were a kind of manual for all the
earlier monasteries of the West.<a id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>As to the origin of Irish Monasticism opinions
are divided: some have ascribed it to an Eastern
origin, while others insist that it can be directly
traced to Gaul. The most commonly accepted
view is that of Mr. Willis Bund<a id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> which ascribes to
it a purely indigenous development. As such
general statements are at best but partly true and
utterly fail to give an adequate idea of the characteristics
of Irish monasticism we propose to
examine the subject in the light derived from such
native sources of information as:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<ol class="sources">
  <li>The Irish Monastic Rules,<a
      id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></li>
  <li>The Lives of the Early Irish Saints,<a
      id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></li>
  <li>Ecclesiastical History, and</li>
  <li>Social and Political History.</li>
</ol>

<p class="noindent">From the first and second sources we shall learn
much about the spirit of monastic life, its ideals,
obligations, and daily routine. From the third and
fourth sources, and incidentally from the other two,
we learn much about the relation which existed
between the monastery and the community in
which it was located.</p>

<p>An examination of Irish Monastic Rules, so far as
they have come down to us, reveals the fact that they
are not identical with any Eastern or Western Code.
In the general severity of their regulations they are
found, on comparison, to resemble the former rather
than the latter. It was doubtless this austerity that
caused the Irish Rules to give way eventually
before the milder Rule of St.&nbsp;Benedict.<a id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> It is
possible, however, that the ideas and literature of
Gallic and Egyptian monasticism may have influenced
to some extent the development of Irish
monasticism.<a id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Whether Irish monasticism was of native origin
or not there can be little doubt that British monasticism
exercised a very potent and direct influence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
on its development. In an Irish document which is
generally accepted as historical, we are informed
that there were Three Orders of Saints.<a id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The
First Order flourished c. 440–534&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> Many of
the saints in this Order lived in the time of St.
Patrick. They were all bishops and founders of
churches. Their number was 350 and included
Britons, Romans, Franks and Scots. The Second
Order (534–572&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>) was made up of few bishops
and many priests: they numbered 300. Unlike
the First Order these refused the services of women
separating them from their monasteries. They
received a Mass from SS. David, Gillas, and
Docus the Britons. The Third Order consisted of
holy priests and a few bishops. The number of
this Order was 100; they dwelt in desert places
living mainly on herbs and water; they depended
upon alms and possessed no private property.</p>

<p>The Second Order interests us especially as in
all probability the monasteries owe their origin to
its members. Whether St.&nbsp;Patrick actually founded
monasteries is uncertain. We know that he spent
some years at Lerins, the island monastery of the
Mediterranean, but his life was too full of missionary
labours to have time for the foundation and government
of monasteries.<a id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> In strong contrast with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the First Order who were mainly foreigners, the
Second Order of Saints were all natives of Ireland.
However, they came under the influence of British
monasticism in two ways. We have seen above
that three British or Welsh saints visited Ireland
during this period, and indeed so did several
others.<a id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Of equal importance is the fact that
several Irish saints visited Britain about this time.
In South Wales there were two centres of attraction,
Llancarvon under St.&nbsp;Cadoc and Menevia
under St.&nbsp;David.<a id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> St.&nbsp;Finnian of Clonard, “the
tutor of the Saints of Erin,” was a pupil of St.
Cadoc at Llancarvon, as was St.&nbsp;Cainnech. Maedoc
was a pupil of St.&nbsp;David’s, as were Modomnoc and
Scuithin, while we hear of Finnian of Clonard,
Declan, Bairre and Senan as visitors there.<a id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The
saints of the North of Ireland tended to gravitate
towards a monastery in the territory of the Niduari
Picts, sometimes called Strathclyde, in the South-west
of Scotland. This monastery was called
Whitern (Rosnat in Irish sources). Among the
Irish saints who visited Whitern are SS. Enda,
Tighernach, Eoghan of Ardstraw and Finnian of
Movilla.<a id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>
<h3>INFLUENCE OF CLONARD MONASTERY:</h3>

<p>About the middle of the sixth century a great
monastic movement took rise from the monastery
established at Clonard by Finnian c. 525&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span><a id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
Under him were trained for missionary work many
of the most illustrious fathers of the Irish church
including the “Twelve Apostles of Erin,”<a id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> viz.
Ciaran of Seir, Ciaran of Clonmacnoise, Columba
(Colum Cille), Brendan of Clonfert, Brendan of
Birr, Columba or Colman of Terryglass, Molaise of
Devenish, Canice of Aghaboe, Ruadan of Lorrha,
Mobi of Glasnevin, Sinnel of Cleenish, and Ninnidh
or Nennius of Inishmacsaint.<a id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> According to another
authority, the names of Finnian of Clonard,
Finnian of Movilla, and Comgall of Bangor are substituted
for those of Ciaran of Seir, Molaise of
Devenish, and Sinnel of Cleenish.<a id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The remaining
nine names occur in both lists. These men
going forth in all directions founded numerous
monasteries and schools which afterwards became
famous throughout Europe.<a id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> St.&nbsp;Columba (Colum
Cille) styled in an old record “<i>Monasteriorum
Pater et Fundator</i>” is said to have founded 300
monasteries. Even allowing for the poetic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
imagination of the early chronicler, it is significant
that Reeves in his investigations was able to compile
a list of at least 90 monasteries founded by, or
dedicated to, this saint. Of this number 37 were
located in Ireland, 32 amongst the Scots (of Alba)
and 21 amongst the Picts, <i>i.e.</i> 53 in the country
now called Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> It was mainly through the
efforts of these saints that Ireland was completely
converted to the Christian faith.<a id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> It would appear
that after St.&nbsp;Patrick’s death the druids recovered
some of their former influence and exerted themselves
to the utmost to retard and limit the spread
of the new faith.<a id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Thanks to the zeal and energy
of the saints of this Second Order the influence of
the druids was completely broken down, though the
druids still lingered on obscurely and feebly many
generations.<a id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>When monasticism became general in the sixth
century most, if not all, of those ecclesiastical
seminaries which we have listed as being founded
in the fifth century, became monastic schools.
Some of them such as the School of Armagh
attained a high degree of excellence ranking with
Clonard, Bangor, and the other great schools
which date from the sixth century. We give a list
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of the better-known monastic schools which were
founded during the sixth and seventh centuries, the
most famous being printed in <span class="smcap">CAPITALS</span>. These
schools were all established in Ireland by Irishmen,
who, as far as we have been able to discover,
received their own education for the most part in
schools already in existence in Ireland. This list
makes no pretence to completeness. According
to the calculations of Sir James Ware the number
of famous schools in Ireland amounted to 164.<a id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
Another writer<a id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> gives the names of 168 monasteries
founded prior to 900&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> Even this list is incomplete.
We have checked this latter list for Co.
Louth with one compiled by a recent reliable investigator<a id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
with the result that 19 or 20 should be
credited to Co. Louth whereas there are only 2 out
of the 168 so accredited. Similarly, we find only
4 monasteries ascribed to St.&nbsp;Columba while, as we
have shown, Reeves found 37 monasteries in Ireland
whose foundation is accredited to this energetic
saint. As we have reason to believe that all these
monasteries had schools, we can easily see how
abundant were the facilities for acquiring such an
education as these schools provided.</p>

<h3>EDUCATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ORGANIZATION<br />
OF THE IRISH CHURCH.</h3>

<p>From what has been said about the spread of
monasticism in Ireland in the sixth century it is
evident that the whole organization of the Church
in Ireland was being placed on a monastic basis.
The importance of this type of organization from
an educational standpoint will be evident when we
recall the actual condition of society at this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
particular period. Closely related to the monastic
character of the Irish Church was its missionary
character. How far reaching the influence of the
Irish Monastic Church was, can be judged from
a brief survey of the distribution of Irish monasteries
in Britain and on the Continent. A list of 122
monasteries founded by Irish monks in Scotland,
in England and on the Continent was collected by
Colgan in a lost work of which the index has been
preserved and printed.<a id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Another writer has shown
that Ireland sent 115 missionaries into Germany,
45 into France, 44 into England, 36 into Belgium,
25 into Scotland and 13 into Italy.<a id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> According to
the testimony of Jonas, biographer of Columbanus,
about 620 missionaries went into Bavaria from
Luxeuil, the headquarters of the missionary work
of Columbanus. No doubt, some of these were
natives of Gaul, but there must have been many
Irish amongst them. Miss Stokes gives the names
of 63 missionaries who in the seventh century spread
the Columban Rule from Luxeuil.<a id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> In the light of
these facts we see how just is the judgment of
Green, the English historian, when he declared
that as the Irish Church overflowed its own territorial
limits and invaded the Continent of Europe,
it was for a time doubtful whether the monastic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
ideal of Christendom would come from a Celtic or
from an Italian source, whether it would be represented
by the Rules of SS. Columba and Columbanus,
or that of St.&nbsp;Benedict.<a id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>


<h3>IMPOSSIBILITY OF COMPILING A COMPLETE LIST<br />
OF MONASTIC SCHOOLS AND SCHOLARS:</h3>

<p>The number of monastic schools and scholars
given in the preceding section though at first sight
somewhat startling is really an under-estimate.
This assertion is based on the following considerations:—</p>


<p>1. The desire which prevailed in the early centuries
of Christianity to imitate even the accidental
features of the Apostolic system naturally suggested
the adoption of the number <i>twelve</i> in the
adjustment of missionary societies. Thus we find
it recorded that in Clonard the “Twelve Apostles
of Erin” were educated. St.&nbsp;Columba set out
about 562&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> with <i>twelve</i> companions to convert
the Picts. St.&nbsp;Columbanus with <i>twelve</i> brethren
left Ireland about 612 to undertake his great
missionary work on the Continent. St.&nbsp;Killian
was the chief of a company of <i>twelve</i> who founded
a monastic institution in Würzburg. St.&nbsp;Eloquius,
disciple of St.&nbsp;Fursa, with <i>twelve</i> companions whose
names are preserved, propagated the Gospel in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Belgium.<a id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
Thus except in the case of the founders
of monasteries there is a very natural tendency to
overlook the other workers, sometimes their names
are not even recorded.</p>


<p>2. During the Danish incursions of the ninth and
tenth centuries many of the Irish monasteries were
destroyed and the monks went to Europe and set
up monasteries wherever they settled. Sometimes
they carried their books with them, but more frequently
their libraries were burned or “drowned”
by the pagan invaders who hated Christianity and
learning, thus the Irish Annals and other documents
are very defective as a means of supplying the
necessary data for the compilation of a tolerably
complete list.<a id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>


<p>3. Even when the names of Irish missionaries are
recorded in Continental MSS. there is often a
difficulty in recognising an Irish name in its Continental
dress. Many of the Irish monks who went
abroad were “re-christened,” sometimes Biblical
names like Joseph or Isaias were adopted, or the
Irish name was latinized to make it more euphonious
to Continental ears. Hence we find <i>Moengal</i>
figuring as Marcellus, just as <i>Maelmuire</i> appears
as Marianus and Mylerius, <i>Maelmeadhog</i> as
Malachy, <i>Giolla Iosa</i> and even <i>Cellach</i> become
Gelasius, <i>Giolla an Coimded</i> figures as Germanus,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
<i>Tuathal</i> as Tutilo, <i>Domnall</i> or <i>Donal</i> as Donatus,
<i>Aed</i> as Aidan and Hugh, <i>Siadhal</i> as Sedulius,
<i>Cellach</i> sometimes became Gall, while others chose
to remain anonymous or describe themselves
vaguely as <i>Exul</i>, or <i>Hibernicus</i>, or <i>Scottus</i>. In
the Continental libraries there are many MSS. in
Irish script and the scribes have concealed their
identity in the vague manner just described.<a id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>


<p>4. Naturally there were many others whose work
was teaching rather than writing, consequently
there is no record in such cases. Columba and
Columbanus were lucky in having biographers but
many others were less fortunate.</p>



<h3>GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF IRISH
MONASTIC SCHOOLS:</h3>

<p>We give a partial list of the better-known monastic
institutions which were at one and the same
time advance posts of civilization and centres of
Christian learning. Many of these date from that
great period of Irish missionary activity, the
seventh century.</p>


<h3>SCOTLAND:</h3>

<p>Almost the whole of the country now called
Scotland was converted to Christianity by Irish
missionaries. With the foundation of the monastery
of Iona in 563&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> by St.&nbsp;Columba, “<i>pater</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
<i>et fundator monasteriorum</i>,” began a period of
great monastic activity in Britain. Reeves found
that 63 monasteries were founded by or dedicated
to St.&nbsp;Columba; of these 32 were in the territory
occupied by the Scots and 21 were among the
Picts.<a id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Other important monasteries were Deer
founded by St.&nbsp;Drostan, a disciple of St.&nbsp;Columba,
Lismore founded by St.&nbsp;Moluag in 592&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>, and
Righ-Monadh or Kilrimont founded by St.&nbsp;Canice
near the place where St.&nbsp;Andrew’s University is
now located.<a id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> There were also numerous small
monasteries on the islands round the Scottish
coast.<a id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The beneficent influence exercised by
these foundations as civilizing and educational
agencies is acknowledged by modern Scottish
historians.<a id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>


<h3>ENGLAND:</h3>

<p>Just as Iona was the great headquarters of
monastic activity for Scotland, so Lindisfarne
founded by the Irish St.&nbsp;Aidan in 635&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> became
the base of operations for the Irish missionaries in
the North of England, especially in Northumbria.
At this time Northumbria was an extensive kingdom
extending as far south as the Humber and into
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
modern Scotland as far north as the Firth of Forth.
To the influence of Aidan and other Irish monks we
trace the foundation of Lindisfarne, Coldingham,
Mailros, Lastingham, in Northumbria, Ripon and
Streanshalch (now Whitby) in Yorkshire, Burgh
Castle in Suffolk, St.&nbsp;Bees in Lancashire, Malmesbury
among the West Saxons, Bosham or Bosanham
in Sussex, and “Glastonbury of the Gael” in
Somerset.<a id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> In most histories the missionary work
of St.&nbsp;Augustine is grossly exaggerated and the
important missionary and educational work of the
Irish monks is either completely ignored or accorded
an amount of space utterly out of proportion to its
importance.<a id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<h3>RELATION OF THE IRISH MONASTIC CHURCH TO
THE ROMAN CHURCH:</h3>

<p>The preceding section will enable us to understand
what an important influence from a religious,
as well as from an educational, standpoint the Irish
monastic system began to exercise throughout the
West of Europe. The relation which existed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
between the Irish Church and the Roman Church
has given rise to considerable polemic discussion.
Indeed there are so many points in common between
the Irish monastic church of the sixth, seventh,
and eighth centuries and the British or Welsh
church of the same period that both are often
spoken of as the “Celtic Church” in contradistinction
to the Roman Church. This distinction is
based not on any essential difference of doctrine<a id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
but on certain differences of ritual, liturgy, and
discipline. As we have shown the Irish monastic
system extended far beyond the territorial limits
occupied by the Celtic race. Hence when we refer
to the Celtic Church we have in mind a widespread
organization rather than a locality, and we
emphasize differences of custom and not essentials
of dogma. The differences that existed between
the Roman Church and the Celtic Church with
regard to the date of Easter and to the tonsure of
the monks gave rise to an important controversy in
the seventh century.<a id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>


<h3>THE CALCULATION OF EASTER:</h3>

<p>Prior to the Council of Nice 325&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> the date of
Easter in the nascent Celtic Church harmonized
with that of the Roman Church. Owing, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
to isolation the Celtic Church had never adopted the
various alterations and improvements which on
astronomical—not on theological—grounds had
been accepted by the Continental Church.<a id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>


<h3>THE TONSURE CONTROVERSY:</h3>

<p>The Roman tonsure was formed by shaving the
top of the head in a circle leaving a crown of hair
around it. The Eastern tonsure, sometimes called
the Pauline tonsure, was total. The Celtic tonsure
was formed by shaving all the hair in front of a line
drawn from ear to ear.<a id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> In the controversy of the
seventh century the Roman party traced their form
to St.&nbsp;Peter and attributed that of their opponents
to Simon Magus.<a id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The Irish form, <i>ab aure ad
aurem</i>, existed in St.&nbsp;Patrick’s time<a id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and was
probably druidical in origin.<a id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>These two questions, though in themselves of
minor importance, gave rise to a controversy of
many years’ duration. Eventually the Roman
practice was adopted by the whole Celtic Church,
but not without a struggle, some localities clinging
tenaciously to the traditional usage long after the
general acceptance of the Continental practice.
The Southern Irish were the first to conform.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Having received an admonition from Pope Honorius
they convened a Synod about 630&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> and as a
result of their deliberations decided to adopt the
Roman usage. The North of Ireland held out
much longer, being influenced by Iona and its
dependent monasteries in Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The dates at
which the different parts of the Celtic Church conformed
with the Roman practice in regard to the
celebration of Easter are given below.<a id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Possibly
the coronal form of tonsure was adopted at the same
time.</p>

<h3>EFFECT OF THE EASTER CONTROVERSY ON
EDUCATION:</h3>

<p>The Irish monks who visited the Continent, as
well as the adherents of the Roman usage in
Britain, advocated and even urged the necessity of
conforming to the Continental practices, but their
compatriots did not yield without a struggle. As
we have shown, certain parts of Britain in which
the Celtic Church held sway were even more
reluctant to give up the traditional usages. So far
as the general interests of education are concerned
this controversy had a somewhat harmful effect.
It diverted the attention of scholars from matters
of greater moment and created a certain prejudice
against those Irish teachers who were not prepared
to give up the cherished customs of the founders of
their monasteries. For example, after the Synod
of Whitby in 664&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> when Celtic usage was
abolished, St.&nbsp;Colman and a number of Anglo-Saxon
followers retired from Lindisfarne and founded
a monastery on Inisbofinn, an island off the west
coast of Ireland. It must not, however, be assumed
that the Irish influence in England ceased with the
departure of St.&nbsp;Colman and his followers. At the
Synod of Whitby some of the most vigorous advocates
of the Roman usage were Irishmen, while
amongst the Anglo-Saxons there were many
champions of the Celtic usage.<a id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> For at least thirty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
years after the Synod of Whitby the Irish influence
was felt. A native ministry having been trained
the Irish monks had accomplished their work.<a id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> In
one respect the Easter controversy had a good
effect on learning. It led to a careful study of the
computation and astronomy and created the necessity of
becoming familiar with all the classical and ecclesiastical
literature which was calculated to throw any
light on that vexed question. The consequence of
this study was that the Irish monks became the
greatest astronomers of the seventh, eighth and
ninth centuries. It is enough to read the Paschal
Epistle of Cummian Fada (d. 661)<a id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> or the famous
letter of Dungal who in 810&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> was asked by
Charles the Great to explain the double eclipse of
the sun which was supposed to have occurred in
that year,<a id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> to be convinced of the superiority of
their scholarship.</p>


<h3>ORGANIZATION OF THE IRISH MONASTERY ON A
TRIBAL BASIS:</h3>

<p>In marked contrast with the other Western
churches which were organized on a national and
episcopal basis the Irish Church was tribal and
monastic. This was quite natural. The conversion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
of the chieftain was followed by the conversion
of the clansmen and a tribal character was thus
given to the nascent church.<a id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> At an early date
the Irish Church took a monastic form which
accorded so well with the native social system.
The abbot became chief of an ecclesiastical clan
most of whose members were descended from the
same common ancestor as the abbot himself. No
wonder the native name for the monastic community
was <i>muintir</i>, usually translated <i>familia</i>.<a id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Even the
successor of the abbot—the <i>coarb</i>, literally heir—could
often claim lineal descent from the same
chieftain as the abbot whom he succeeded. Of
course, as the abbot was unmarried, there could be
no direct lineal succession from the first abbot, but
there was a succession in the manner indicated.
There was thus a close resemblance between the
succession of the abbot and that of the chieftain.
The successor of the chieftain was not necessarily
his son, but a member of the clan by whom he was
selected on account of his personal fitness for the
position. In the case of the monastery of Iona
it has been noted that Columba and thirteen of his
successors were descended from a common
ancestor, an Irish chief named Conall Gulban.<a id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
The monastic family consisted of <i>fratres</i>: those of
tried devotion were called <i>seniores</i>; those who were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
strong for labour were <i>operarii fratres</i>; and those
under instruction were <i>juniores</i>, <i>alumni</i>, or <i>pueri
familiares</i>. Besides the congregation—<i>collectio</i>—of
professed members there were usually present
<i>peregrini</i>, sometimes called <i>proselyti</i>, <i>poenitentes</i>,
or <i>hospites</i> whose sojourn was of varied duration.<a id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The number of officers was relatively small, the more important
being the <i>abbot</i>, the <i>prior</i>, the <i>episcopus</i>,
the <i>scriba</i>, and the <i>Erinach</i> or <i>Airchinneach</i>.
The <i>abbot</i> was the superior of the monastic family and frequently
had several houses under his supreme control. He generally lived at
the mother house. The branch houses were governed by local superiors
called <i>priors</i> who were subject to removal by the abbot. There was
also a prior at the mother house who assisted the abbot and took his
place in administration when his superior was absent. The prior in this
latter capacity is sometimes styled <i>custos monasterii</i>, sometimes
<i>oeconomus</i>, and in the Irish Annals, <i>Fertighis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>An interesting fact in connection with the Irish
monastic organization is that the abbot was not
necessarily a bishop.<a id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> In matters of discipline and
jurisdiction the abbot was supreme whether he was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
a bishop or not. But if he were not a bishop there
were certain duties which he could not perform. The
bishop (episcopus) as such and in virtue of his office
performed such functions as administration of Confirmation
and Holy Orders just as at present. Of
course the abbot was frequently a bishop and consequently
was vested with correspondingly increased
powers.<a id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>The abbot sometimes combined the office of
scribe with his other duties. The special work of
the scribe will be dealt with later; here it is sufficient
to note that the office of scribe was held in such
honour that we often find it recorded of a certain
saint that he was an excellent scribe, while as if of
secondary importance, it is added that he was an
abbot, or bishop.<a id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>The lands belonging to the monastery or church
were usually managed by an officer called an
erinach, or herenach (in Irish, Airchinneach). The
erinach, who was usually a layman, first deducted
his own stipend and gave the residue for the purposes
intended—the support of the church, or the
relief of the poor. It was generally understood to
be the duty of the erinach to keep the church clean
and in proper repair, and the grounds in order.
There were erinachs in connection with nearly all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the monasteries and churches.<a id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Lay erinachs were
usually tonsured.<a id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>


<h3>REVENUES AND MEANS OF SUPPORT.</h3>

<p>The monasteries derived their means of support
from a variety of sources, the chief being: <i>Lands</i>,
<i>Tithes</i>, <i>Fees</i> and <i>Dues</i>, and <i>Gifts</i>.</p>

<p>By far the most important of all these means of
support were the lands attached to the monastery.
These lands, called <i>Termon</i> lands in Ireland,
derived their name in all probability from the
<i>termini</i>, pillar stones, or crosses set up to mark
their boundaries within which there was right of
sanctuary, and a freedom from the taxes and
tributes of the secular chieftains.<a id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> These lands
were tilled by the monks themselves and formed the
staple support of the establishment.<a id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> It was a
maxim in all the primitive monasteries that the
monks support themselves by the labour of their
own hands. The mendicant orders, who depended
largely upon alms were a later institution, first introduced
into Ireland about 1225&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span><a id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The
monastic lands were sometimes increased by special
grants from kings, or chiefs. These special grants
when added to the foundation grant sometimes made
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
up an extensive territory.<a id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> When the lands became
too large for the community to work, a portion
of them was rented to tenants. Part of the duty
of the erinach was to collect the rents and other
tributes from the tenants.<a id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Ordinarily the monastery
was a self-supporting institution. The community
produced everything they needed for food,
clothing, and shelter. They owed little to society
in general but society owed much to them.<a id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> There
was no privileged class in these early monasteries.
All who were physically fit had to take part in the
manual labour, nor were the scribes or even the
abbot exempt.<a id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>In parts of the <i>Senchus Mór</i>,<a id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> one of the ancient
books of law, it is prescribed as a duty of society
to pay tithes, as well as to bestow alms and first
fruits to the Church, but tithes were not generally
nor regularly paid until after the Norman invasion
in 1172&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span><a id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Another subsidiary, but occasionally
substantial, means of support was the dues paid by
the tribe to the abbot for the performance of
various religious functions.<a id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The Brehon Laws
lay down specifically the reciprocal obligations of
the clergy and laity in this manner.<a id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> In this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
connection<a id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> it should be pointed out that owing to its
position in the native social system “the Church
in Ireland never became as in other lands by turns
the servant, the ally, or the master of the State.
It was the companion of the people, and an important
element in the national life.”</p>

<p>Gifts, or voluntary offerings, were a further
source of income, but a fluctuating one, depending
largely on the location of the monastery, its reputation,
the social condition of its patrons, and a variety
of other accidental circumstances. Almost all
persons who visited a monastery left something of
value, if their means permitted. In early times
the offerings, like other payments, were in ounces
of gold or silver, or in kind. When Brian Boru
visited Armagh in 1004&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> he laid on the great
altar an offering of twenty ounces of gold, equivalent
to $5000 or $7000 at the present day.<a id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>


<h3>THE BUILDINGS:</h3>

<p>The monastery including the whole group of
monastic buildings was generally, but not always,
surrounded by a strong rampart, commonly circular
or elliptical, after the manner of the homesteads of
the laity. The enclosure with its bounding rampart
was designated in Irish by various names. When
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the wall was of earth it was called a <i>rath</i>,
or <i>lios</i>. If surrounded by a stone wall it was
known as a <i>caiseal</i> or sometimes a <i>cathair</i>.<a id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
Sometimes the monks located themselves in a rath
or lios surrendered by a friendly chief,<a id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and sometimes
the monks built the enclosure themselves.<a id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
So much was the rampart a feature of the Irish
monastery that we find it in connection with the
monasteries founded by Irish monks in foreign
lands. A <i>vallum monasterii</i> is mentioned by
Adamnan,<a id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and Columbanus utilised the walls of the
old Roman <i>castrum</i> to serve as the <i>vallum</i> for his
monastery at Luxeuil.<a id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> The monastery proper
was the space enclosed by the vallum and included
the church or churches, the oratories, the refectory,
the kitchen, the school, the armarium—a chamber
for the preservation of books and literary apparatus,
sometimes a special scriptorium, the hospice or
guest house, the cells for the monks, and the
officinae or workshops for the smith and the
carpenter.<a id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Outside of the vallum were the various
other indispensable buildings connected with the
monastery of which the storehouse and the mill are
the most important. There was usually a byre
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
for the cows situated in convenient pasture land.
If the monastery was located inland there was a
fish pond; or a convenient harbour, if near the sea.
The various buildings occupied different situations
according to local convenience.<a id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>The structure of these early monasteries was of
a simple and inexpensive character. Like the early
Celtic churches, they were built at first of earth,
wattles, or wood. It was not until the eighth
century that stone buildings began to be substituted
for wooden ones, as a protection against the ravages
of the Danes.<a id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The simplicity and temporary
character of these early foundations would account
for the quickness with which monastic cities sprang
up as well as for the fact that comparatively few
material remains of these monastic settlements are
now to be seen. They are now remembered chiefly
for the great spiritual and literary heritage which
they were the means of transmitting.</p>

<p>They were of various sizes. Those planted on
barren islands off the coast of Ireland and Scotland
must have been small. In each of the great
monasteries of Clonard, Bangor and Clonfert there
were 3000, including probably both monks and
students. St.&nbsp;Molaise had 1,500 at Mungret, St.
Gobban had 1000 and so on down to the school of
St.&nbsp;Mobi at Glasnevin with 50. This last number,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
fifty, seems to have been the usual number in the
smaller monastic schools.<a id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>


<h3>DAILY LIFE IN AN IRISH MONASTERY:</h3>

<p>The investigations of scholars in recent years
brought to light several Rules<a id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> which were written
by early Irish saints for the direction and guidance
of their monks. These Rules were frequently
referred to in ancient documents, but some
historians doubted their existence until their discovery
set all doubts aside and furnished another
proof of the trustworthiness of Irish records. By
comparing these Rules with the references in the
<i>Lives of the (Irish) Saints</i><a id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> to the domestic and
religious discipline of the monks we are able to form
a tolerably correct picture of the real character of
monastic life in Ireland during the period under consideration.
While these Rules are neither so
elaborate nor so systematic as the famous <i>Rule of
St.&nbsp;Benedict</i>, to which they eventually gave place,
yet they enable us to realize the austere simplicity
of Irish monasticism.</p>

<p>However they may differ in details these “Rules
of the Irish Saints” are in agreement as to the
character of the daily work. St.&nbsp;Columbanus thus
tersely describes the work of an Irish monastery:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
“Ergo quotidie jejunandum est, sicut quotidie
orandum est, quotidie laborandum, quotidie est
legendum.”<a id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Fasting and prayer, labour and
study were the daily task of the monk in every Irish
monastery.</p>


<h3>FASTING:</h3>

<p>During the whole year Wednesday and Friday
were fast days in Iona and no food was taken before
noon unless some “troublesome guest”<a id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> rendered
a dispensation desirable; for charity went before
sacrifice in the old Irish Canon. During Lent and
Advent only one meal was allowed and that was
taken in the evening.<a id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Though the custom of Iona
was severe, it was mildness itself as compared with
that of Bangor. Only one meal was allowed
the whole year round and that not eaten until
evening.<a id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The quality of food in Bangor was
inferior to that of Iona where, as Reeves has shown,
the dietary consisted of bread (sometimes made of
barley), milk, fish, eggs, and probably seal’s flesh.
On Sundays and festivals the monks were sometimes
allowed some additional luxury.<a id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> In Bangor,
as later in Luxeuil, Anegray, and Bobbio the food
apparently consisted of cabbage, pulse, flour mixed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
with water, a little portion of biscuit and fish.<a id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
Beer was sometimes allowed as a drink even by
Columbanus,<a id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> but on the other hand St.&nbsp;Maelruan
of Tallaght was such a strict disciplinarian that not
only did he prohibit the use of beverage, but even
music was forbidden.<a id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>


<h3>PRAYER:</h3>

<p>A considerable portion of both day and night was
given to the work of praising God. Eight times<a id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
a day did the monks attired in their white robes
wend their way to the church for the great work of
their life—the <i>Opus Dei</i>, the “Celebration of the
Divine Praises.” Mass was generally celebrated
at an early hour each morning before the labour of
the day began. The ordinary Canonical Hours
were chanted in choir—Matins and Lauds generally
at midnight. The Divine Office was made up of
the Psalms and Lessons from the Old and New
Testament. The entire Psaltery appears to have
been recited during the daily office at least at certain
times of the year.<a id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Sometimes the choir was
divided into groups which in turn chanted the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Divine Praises day and night without intermission.
In the monastery of Tallaght the Gospels were
read in the refectory at meal times, the Gospels
being taken in turn, one for each season of the
year.<a id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<h3>LABOUR:</h3>

<p>We have referred to the obligation that was
placed upon all members of the monastic community
to engage on some kind of manual labour.<a id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Tasks
requiring special skill were assigned to monks who
had a natural aptitude for such work. Thus the
duties of carpenter, smith, and brazier were assigned
to specially qualified monks.<a id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Yet even the
scribes and artistic craftsmen were required to spend
part of their time at ordinary manual work.<a id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The
word <i>laborare</i> is used in a wider sense than our term
<i>manual labour</i>. The Rule of St.&nbsp;Columba defines
the term “work” in these words: “Work is
divided into three parts: viz., thine own work, and
the work of the place as regards its real wants;
secondly, thy share of the brethren’s work; lastly,
helping the neighbours by instruction, or writing, or
sewing garments, or whatever labour they may be
in want of.”<a id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Never to be idle for one moment
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
was the monastic ideal. Accordingly Adamnan
represents his hero as unable “to pass the space of
one hour without applying himself either to prayer
or reading, or writing, or else some manual
work.”<a id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>


<h3>STUDY:</h3>

<p>In subsequent chapters we shall deal with the
monks in their capacity as teachers and scribes.
Here we shall refer briefly to their fourth task—legendum,
reading or study. The study of the
Sacred Scriptures was practised daily by the more
learned members of the community, while the
younger members learned by rote a portion of the
Psalter each day until they could repeat the whole
of it from memory. The story of how St.&nbsp;Columba
when a tiny boy took up the Psalm where his tutor
broke down is well known, while the numerous
glosses on the Psalms and other portions of the
Bible are convincing proofs of the intensive study
of the Scriptures by these early monks.<a id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Homilies
or Lives of the Saints formed part of the sacred
reading and we may reasonably suppose that the
reading of the Gospels in the refectory during meal
hours was a practice which was not confined to the
monastery of Tallaght, nor was such reading
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
limited to this particular time of the day. Indeed
early Irish religious literature clearly points to a
familiarity with the Holy Book.</p>


<h3>OTHER PRACTICES AND CHARACTERISTICS OF IRISH
MONASTIC LIFE: OBEDIENCE:</h3>

<p>The ideal of prompt and unhesitating obedience
to the commands of his superiors, so characteristic
of the Irish monk, is one which cannot be understood
apart from the Irish conception of Monasticism as
“fighting for Christ.” In all things lawful the
monk yielded prompt and unquestioning obedience
and was ready to go to the ends of the earth if his
superior should only speak the word. The conception
that the monk should be a “<i>miles Christi</i>”<a id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
was particularly adapted to the native temperament.
To the pagan ideals of “truth, courage, and
strength” were added the Christian virtues of
obedience to authority, self-sacrifice, and devotion
to the welfare of mankind without distinction of race
or country. With such ideals they bravely encountered
all privations and dangers when they
undertook their “peregrinatio pro Christo.”
<i>Humility</i> was prized as a Christian virtue and was
exemplified in many ways. The superiors though
exacting prompt obedience and due respect from
their monks were not tyrannical and led as strict and
simple a life as the other members of the community.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>
<p>There was no private property, all things
were owned in common, and their wealth was limited
to the means of supplying their few and simple
wants. The members of the community exemplified
their humility both in their demeanour towards their
superiors and in dejection after sin.<a id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>


<h3>MORAL COURAGE:</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding their humility these monks
could, and did, show a high degree of moral courage
when occasion demanded. This is shown by the
action of St.&nbsp;Columba when he confronted the Irish
King and the assembled chieftains at the Convention
of Drumceat (575&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Against great
popular opposition he pleaded the cause of the
Bardic Order and appealed for the freedom of the
Irish colony in Scotland. In both cases success
crowned his efforts. Still more daring was the
action of St.&nbsp;Columbanus in his dealings with the
Merovingian King, Theuderic, to whom he wrote
a letter full of the bitterest reproaches and threatening
to excommunicate him, if he did not immediately
amend his sinful life. Thus did Columbanus
draw upon himself not only the anger of the king
but that of the crafty and cruel Brunechildis.
Nothing daunted, however, he defied alike both
their threats and violence. He adhered steadfastly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
to principle even though that adherence
caused him to be driven from the kingdom of the
Franks.<a id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>


<h3>SILENCE:</h3>

<p>There was silence in the refectory during meals
so that the reader could be distinctly heard, and
silence was compulsory at other times also. Indeed,
in their intercourse with each other the conversation
of the monks was reserved at all times, but as
regards their relation to society at large the objects
of their system were too practical and their engagements
too much characterized by common sense to
impose any restraint in conversation but such as
conduced to dignity and decorum.<a id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>


<h3>HOSPITALITY:</h3>

<p>The monastery was usually located so as to be
easily accessible to visitors for whom a special
Hospice or Guest-house was provided. We have
seen that when a guest arrived there was a relaxation
of the fast—so strongly had the national
characteristic of hospitality pervaded the monastic
life.<a id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Women, however, were rigidly excluded
from the monastery.<a id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<h3>LOVE OF NATURE:</h3>

<p>Another notable characteristic was the love of
the monks for nature, animate and inanimate. This
is shown in many ways, such as in the selection of
the sites of their monasteries, and in their treatment
of animals. Moreover, they often gave expression
to their feelings for nature in verse, with the result
that they are acknowledged to be pioneers in the
field of “Nature Poetry” as well as in many other
spheres of intellectual activity.<a id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Having regard to all the facts we have brought
together Dr. Healy’s eloquent tribute to Irish
monasticism appears to be amply justified. It is
worth quoting:</p>

<p>“Fasting and prayer, labour and study are the
daily task of the monks in every monastery. How
well and unselfishly that toil was performed the
history of Europe tells. The monks made roads,
cleared the forests, and fertilised the desert. Their
monasteries in Ireland were the sites of our cities. &hellip;
They preserved for us the literary
treasures of antiquity; they multiplied copies of
the best and newest books; they illumined them
with loving care. They taught the children of rich
and poor alike; &hellip; they were the greatest
authors, painters, architects since the decline
of the Roman Empire. They were the physicians
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of the poor; they served the sick in their hospitals
and in their homes. And when the day’s work was
done in the fields or in the study, they praised God,
and prayed for men who were unable or unwilling
to pray for themselves. Ignorant and prejudiced
men have spoken of them as an idle and useless
race. They were in reality the greatest toilers,
and the greatest benefactors of humanity the world
has ever known.”<a id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p class="subtitle2">THE RELATION OF THE IRISH MONASTIC SCHOOLS<br />
TO THE GENERAL EDUCATIONAL SITUATION
(550–900&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>):</p>


<p>The wide distribution of Irish monastic schools
throughout Ireland, Scotland, England, France,
Belgium, Germany, and even Italy, was discussed
in the previous chapter. Reference was also made
to the numerous Irish missionaries who going
abroad were regarded as “representative of a
higher culture than was then to be found on the
Continent.”<a id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Here we shall consider the general
educational situation in Ireland with a view to determine
the causes which produced results of such
moment to the spread of Christianity and to restoration
of learning.</p>

<p>During the sixth, seventh and eighth centuries
the greater part of Britain and Europe was in a
state of turmoil consequent on the barbarian invasion
while Ireland escaped the ravages such an invasion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
entails. During this period of relative domestic
peace Ireland was an oasis in the educational desert
of Europe; then, if ever, she deserved to be styled
“the school of the West, the quiet habitation of
sanctity and literature.”<a id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> In bringing about this
desirable state of affairs, no doubt, the monastic
schools took a leading part, but there were other
contributory factors the chief of which was the lay
schools whose relation to the monastic will now be
touched upon very briefly. We shall also endeavour
to determine the extent to which education prevailed
among the different classes of society—and finally
we shall discuss the question of the admission of
foreign students to Irish monastic schools.</p>

<h3>DUAL SYSTEM OF SCHOOLS:</h3>

<p>The schools of ancient Ireland were of two
classes, lay and ecclesiastical. The ecclesiastical
or monastic schools as we have seen were of
Christian origin, and were conducted by monks.
The lay, or secular, schools existed from a
period of unknown antiquity, and in pagan times
were taught by druids. The monastic schools were
celebrated all over Europe during the Middle Ages:
the lay schools though playing an important part
in spreading learning at home are not so well known.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p>These two classes of schools are quite distinct all
through the literary history of Ireland, and without
conflicting with each other worked contemporaneously
from the sixth to the nineteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<h3>LAY SCHOOLS:</h3>

<p>As we are mainly interested in the monastic
schools we shall deal with the lay schools only so far
as is necessary to explain the general educational
situation in Ireland during the period we have
chosen. Originally pagan and taught by druids
these lay schools held their ground after the general
spread of the new faith, but were now taught by
Christian <i>ollamhna</i> or doctors, laymen who took the
place of the druid teachers of earlier times.<a id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>The aim of these schools at first was apparently
to prepare a limited number of men as <i>brehons</i> or
judges, and <i>filí</i> or poets, and <i>senachidhe</i> or
historians. In very early times the same man performed
two or more of these offices. In later times
there was a tendency to specialization. A lay
college generally comprised three distinct schools.
We are told that Cormac MacAirt, King of Ireland
(254–277&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>) founded three schools, one for the
study of Military Science, one for Law and one for
General Literature.<a id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> It would appear that schools
of this last type developed into the “Bardic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Schools” in which were taught poetry, history, and
vernacular literature in general. The law schools
and military schools were evidently exclusively professional,
whereas the “Bardic Schools” were
attended by those seeking admission to the Bardic
Order and others desiring a liberal education.<a id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>


<h3>RE-ORGANIZATION OF BARDIC SCHOOLS:</h3>

<p>The members of Bardic Order became so
numerous and exacting in their demands as to
arouse widespread dissatisfaction with the result
that the complete abolition of the Order was contemplated.
Owing to the timely intervention of
St.&nbsp;Columba reform was substituted for abolition.
At the Convention of Drum-Ceata in 573&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> St.
Columba who had received part of his own education
in a Bardic School pleaded the cause of the
bards with such success that the whole system of
public secular education was reorganized. The
scheme was devised by the chief poet (<i>ard-ollamh</i>)
of Ireland, Dallan Forgaill. There was to be a
chief school or college for each of the five
provinces; and under these were several smaller
schools, one for each <i>tuath</i> or district. They were
all endowed with lands and all those persons who
needed it received free education in them. The
heads of these schools were <i>ollamhna</i> doctors of
literature and poetry, and were all laymen.<a id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>There was now a great tendency towards specialization. Many schools
became noted for the excellency of their teaching in particular branches
of learning according to the individual tastes or bent of mind of the
teachers or the traditions of the several schools. These subjects
whether Law, History, Antiquities, Poetry, etc. were commonly taught by
the same family for generations.<a id="FNanchor_202"></a><a
href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<h3>EDUCATION OF LAYMEN:</h3>

<p>It has sometimes been asserted that in early times learning in
Ireland was confined to ecclesiastics, but this assertion is quite
erroneous. We have shown that there were numerous facilities afforded
laymen both for a professional and a general education. Nearly all the
professional men, physicians, lawyers (Brehons), poets, builders, and
historians were laymen; lay tutors were employed to teach princes; and
in fact laymen played a very important part in the diffusion of
knowledge and in building up that character for learning that rendered
Ireland famous in former times.<a id="FNanchor_203"></a><a
href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> A glance through Ware’s
<i>Irish Writers</i>, or O’Reilly’s <i>Irish Writers</i>, or Hyde’s
<i>Literary History of Ireland</i> or Miss Hull’s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
<i>Text Book of Irish Literature</i> is enough to convince the most
sceptical on this point.<a id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204"
class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<h3>RELATION OF THE LAY SCHOOL TO THE MONASTIC SCHOOL:</h3>

<p>Though differing in aim, both the lay school and
the monastic school were so closely related to the
social system that there does not appear to have
been any actual antagonism between them. They
were to a large extent complementary. As an
instance of the friendly relations which obtained
between the ecclesiastics and the lay school we
might cite the fact, already referred to, that St.
Columba pleaded the cause of the bards. St.
Columba himself had practical experience of the
bards as teachers. We are told that after he had
spent some years at the monastic school of Finnian
of Movilla and having been ordained deacon he
placed himself under the instruction of an aged bard
called Gemman.<a id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Nor did his monks in the severe
and pious solitude of Iona lose their love for their
national poetry. On one occasion it is recorded
they inquired from the saint why he did not ask an
Irish poet who visited Iona to recite a poem for them
after the sermon—a question that did not scandalize
the saint in the least.<a id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> We know also that much
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of the pagan literature was preserved by monastic
scribes, and some of the finest Old Irish poems
that have been discovered were written by monks
on the margin of MSS. they were copying.<a id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> These
examples are given for the purpose of removing a
false impression that there was a clear cut line of
demarcation between the study of native and
classical literature. As a learned French Celticist
writes: “On aurait tort de croire qu’en Irelande
il y eût entre les savants addonés aux lettres
classiques où à la théologie, alors leurs inseparable
associée,—et les gens des lettres voués à la culture
de la littérature nationale, la ligne de séparation
presque infranchissable qu’on remarque
pendant le moyen âge sur le continent.”<a id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand many laymen attended
Monastic schools at some period of their lives not
only to get religious instruction but to get a wider
general education.<a id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Besides laymen were sometimes
professors in the monastic schools, and even
occupied the important position of Fer-leighinn or
Principal of a monastic school, for example Flann
Mainistrech (d. 1056&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>), a layman and the most
learned scholar in Ireland of his time, was appointed
Fer-leighinn of Monasterboice. About a century
earlier the lay ollamh, Mac Cosse, held a similar
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
position in the great school of Ros-Ailithir, now
Ros Carbery, in Cork.<a id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>Owing to the increasing popularity of the
monastic schools and the appointment of laymen as
professors in monastic schools there was a tendency
to introduce into the Bardic school some of the
subjects which attracted lay students to monastic
schools. St.&nbsp;Bricin’s College at Tomregan (recte
Tuaim Drecain) near Ballyconnel in Cavan, founded
in the seventh century, though having an ecclesiastic
for Principal was typical of the lay schools. It
had one school for law, one for classics, and one for
poetry and general Gaelic learning. Each school
was under a special <i>druimcli</i>, or head professor,<a id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
corresponding apparently to a Dean in a modern
university.</p>

<h3>HOME EDUCATION AND FOSTERAGE:</h3>

<p>Thus far we have dealt with literary and professional
education. It remains to add a few words
in regard to what may be called home education.
This education was partly literary and partly
technical in nature, and differed according to the
age, sex, and social position of the child.</p>

<p>In addition to the usual literary education the
sons of the chiefs were instructed in archery,
swimming, and chess-playing,<a id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> while the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
daughters were taught sewing, cutting-out and
embroidery. The sons of chiefs were also taught
horsemanship. The children of the wealthy class
were often put to fosterage and the foster father
was held responsible for the instruction in these
branches for neglect of which he was punished by
a fine of two-thirds the fosterage fee. The Brehon
Law clearly defines the relation between the teacher
and pupil in the following words:</p>

<p>“The social position that is considered between
the foster-pupil and his foster-father is that the
latter is to instruct him without reserve, and to
prepare him for his degree, and to chastise him
without severity; to feed and to clothe him while
he is learning his lawful profession unless he obtains
it (food and clothing) from another person. On
the other hand, the foster son is to assist his tutor
in poverty, and support his old age, and to give
him the honour price of the degree for which he is
being prepared, and all the gains of his art while
he is earning it, and the first earning of his art after
he has left the house of his tutor; and moreover the
literary foster father has power of judgment and
proof and witnesses upon his foster son as the
father has upon his son.”<a id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>In the case of children who were put to fosterage
the parents were apparently left to their own discretion
as to the training of their children in their own
homes. In such a case the instruction was of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
more or less technical type that all must master to
a greater or less extent in order to discharge the
ordinary duties of life.<a id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the facilities afforded by the
numerous lay and monastic schools the great body
of the people were probably neither able to read or
write, yet they were not uneducated. They had
an education of another kind, reciting poetry,
historical tales, and legends, or listening to recitation
in which all took delight. In every hamlet
there was one or more amateur reciters. This
practice of listening to the recitation of stories and
poems was then as general as the reading of newspapers
and story-books is at the present day.<a id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
Anyone acquainted with the social life of the Irish-speaking
peasantry even in modern Ireland and has
listened to a story told, or poem recited, by a
<i>seanchaidhe</i> (raconteur) will realise that this was
true education, a real exercise for the intellect and
a refined source of enjoyment. Taking education
then in the broad sense we see that the great body
of the Irish people in these early times were really
educated.</p>


<h3>EDUCATION OF WOMEN:</h3>

<p>We have ample evidence that education in
ancient Ireland was not confined to men. As we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
have already seen, the Brehon Laws made provision
for the education of girls as well as for that of
boys. In a convent established by St.&nbsp;Brigid
(d. 525&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>) at Kildare we are told that St.&nbsp;Mel
was employed to instruct herself and her nurse,<a id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
and the history of that school would lead us to infer
that it compared not unfavourably with some of the
great monastic schools. St.&nbsp;Brendan of Clonfert
(d. 577&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>) when a child about one year old was
placed in fosterage in the convent of St.&nbsp;Ita at
Killeedy, Co. Limerick, where he remained for five
years. This young saint always looked upon St.
Ita as his foster mother and often had listened to
her counsels.<a id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> On one occasion she advised him
not to study with women lest some evilly disposed
person might revile him.<a id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> We may safely infer
from this that it was not unusual for young children
to receive the rudiments of education from the nuns,
but that by the time they reached the age of six
or more probably seven years<a id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> they were sent to
the monastic school. Moreover, St.&nbsp;Ita’s words
of advice clearly suggest that education was provided
for girls but that except in the case of children
of pre-adolescent age she was decidedly opposed to
co-education. Unlike St.&nbsp;Brendan and some other
saints, St.&nbsp;Columbanus was not put to fosterage
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and his childhood’s days were spent in his father’s
home under his mother’s care.<a id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> His latest and
best biographer informs us that he received his
earliest literary education from an elderly lady who
lived near his parent’s home.<a id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> One of the First
Order of Saints named Mugint founded a school in
Scotland to which girls as well as boys were
admitted.<a id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> It is evident likewise that the Irish
missionaries in Northumbria did much for the
education of women. Among the more noteworthy
convents or monasteries for women that owe their
origin to Irish missionaries were St.&nbsp;Bees, Coldingham,
Streanshalch or Whitby which are all
referred to by Bede.<a id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> It was in this last-named
monastery and by the enlightened patronage of
Abbess Hilda that the earliest Anglo-Saxon poet,
Caedmon, was encouraged in his efforts.<a id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> That
women were sometimes accomplished scribes is
quite probable. In an old record we are informed
that in the sixth century King Branduff’s mother
had a writing style (delg graiph), so that she must
have practised writing on waxen tablets,<a id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> this being
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
spoken of in old MSS. as a common practice among
ladies.<a id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>There is not sufficient evidence to justify the
assertion that girls were admitted as students to
monastic schools, though we read that one of the
daughters of the King of Cualann was sent to
Clonard to learn to read her Psalms (in Latin),<a id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> and
Plummer thinks that women taught in this school.<a id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
Probably there was a separate school for women.
From what we know of the Second Order of Saints to
which St.&nbsp;Finnian, the founder of Clonard, belonged
we cannot believe that co-education would be likely
to receive any sanction as a desirable practice in
a monastic school. On the other hand, with
Mugint and the other saints of the First Order such
a practice may possibly have been quite usual; for
“strong in faith they feared not the breath of
temptation.”<a id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Many other instances of educational facilities for
women might be adduced, but enough has been said
to prove the position for which we have been contending,
namely, that though education was not
universal nor compulsory there was ample facilities
for all to acquire a liberal education. That a very
large proportion of both sexes availed themselves of
this privilege there can be no reasonable doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>
<h3>FOREIGN STUDENTS IN IRELAND:</h3>

<p>The fame of the Irish monastic schools of the
seventh, eighth and ninth centuries attracted a
large number of students from foreign lands. To
these the Irish monks extended freely the benefits
of education which during this period were not
available in their own less favoured lands.</p>

<p>The <i>Felire of Aengus</i><a id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> which according to
linguistic and other internal evidence was written
as early as the seventh century<a id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> mentions various
nationalities who have died in Ireland: Romans,
Gauls, sometimes called Franks, monks of Egypt,
and Saxons (more correctly Angles). The well-known
stone inscription “<span class="smcap">VII Romani</span>” in the
churchyard of St.&nbsp;Brecan in Arranmore<a id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> testifies
to this day of presence of Romans. It is also
known that in times of persecution Egyptian monks
fled to Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> In this same calendar of Aengus
mention is made of seven Egyptian monks who died
in one place. Scattered through the <i>Lives of Irish
Saints</i> there are innumerable passages recording the
arrival and departure of foreign pilgrims or students,
or noting their residence or death. Thus we
hear of Britons, including a British bishop, at Clonfert;
of British monks at Rahen, Lynally, Taghmon,
Clonard, Ferns, and Tallaght; of a British
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
priest at Hare Island in Lough Ree; of British
“peregrini” at Tullach Bennan. We even know
the names of many British saints who studied or
resided in Ireland: Cadoc under St.&nbsp;Mocuda at
Lismore, Gildas, Carantoc, Cybi, Petroc, and
Sampson.<a id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Aldhelm, bishop of Shereboree (705–707
<span class="small">A.D.</span>) in a letter to Eadfrid, bishop of Lindisfarne,
states that “fleet loads” of Angles went to Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
A passage in Bede corroborates Aldhelm’s
testimony. Speaking of the ravages of the Yellow
Plague in 664&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> Bede says: “This pestilence
did no less harm in the island of Ireland. Many
of the nobility and of the lower ranks of the English
nation were there at the time who in the days of
the Bishops Finan (651–661) and Colman (661–664),
forsaking their native island retired thither
either for the sake of divine studies, or a more continent
life: and some of them presently devoted
themselves to monastic life; others chose rather to
apply themselves to study, going from one master’s
cell to another. The Scots willingly received them
all, and took care to supply them with food as well
as to furnish them with books to read and their
teaching all gratis.”<a id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> The bishop Finan and
Colman who are referred to by Bede were respectively
the second and third abbots of Lindisfarne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>After the Synod of Whitby (644&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>) Colman and
his English adherents who refused to adopt the
Roman usage with regard to the date of Easter and
the form of tonsure retired to a small island called
Inisbofinn off the coast of Mayo and there founded
a monastery about 667&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> A little later Colman
founded another monastery on the mainland which
he placed in charge of his English companions and
disciples. As late as 730&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> at least this
monastery was occupied by English monks and was
named by the Irish “Mayo of the Saxons.”<a id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> We
know too that one of the divisions of Armagh was
called “Trian Saxon” or the Saxon’s Third from
the great number of English students inhabiting it,
and we learn incidentally that in the eighth century
seven streets in a town called Kilbally near Rahen
in King’s Co. were wholly occupied by Galls, or
foreigners.<a id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>Among the foreign students there were sometimes
princes. Of the more illustrious of these we may
mention Oswald (d. 642) and Ailfrid (d. 704), kings
of Northumbria, and Dagobert II. (d. 679) king of
France, all of whom were educated in Ireland.
Owing to one of those wars so common in England
in the seventh century Oswald, son of King Ethelfrid
of Northumbria, had to seek refuge in Ireland
when he was fifteen years old. He was educated
in a monastery and became a Christian. On
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
regaining his kingdom he sought the aid of the
monks of Iona to convert his heathen subjects. In
635&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> St.&nbsp;Aidan arrived in Northumbria and
founded a monastery on the island of Lindisfarne
which was destined to become the Iona of the
North of England.<a id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Ailfrid, another Northumbria
king, spent his schooldays in Ireland. While there
he was called the Irish Flann Fina (literally Fina’s
Flann) from his mother Fina who was an Irish
princess. There is still extant a very ancient Irish
poem<a id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> which he composed in praise of Ireland.
He would appear to have got a very good education;
for Aldhelm in dedicating to him an epistle on
Latin prosody congratulates him on having been
educated in Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> After the death of King
Sigibert his little son, who eventually became
Dagobert II., was brought by Didon, bishop of
Pointers, to Ireland to be educated. This was done
at the command of Grimoald, Mayor of the
Palace.<a id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> The greatest of English missionaries,
Wilibrord (657–739) was educated in Ireland
where he spent thirteen years. With twelve companions,
some of them Irish, and other English
whom he selected from the Irish schools, he set sail
for Friesland and converted that country to the
Christian faith.<a id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> As Alcuin says so tersely, Britain
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
gave him birth but Ireland reared and educated him.
(“Quem tibi iam genuit fecunda Britannia mater
doctaque nutrivit studiis sed Hibernia sacris.”)<a id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
Bede mentions other Anglo-Saxon missionaries who
in addition to Wilibrord received their training in
Irish schools; of these the most familiar names are
Victbert and Hewald.<a id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Agilbert, a native of Gaul,
after spending some time in Ireland studying the
Scriptures, was appointed bishop of the West
Saxons in 650&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> and later occupied the episcopal
see of Paris.<a id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Other distinguished students were
the Angles, Chad and Egbert. Bede tells us that
Egbert spent a long time in exile in Ireland studying
the Scriptures.<a id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Apparently the prestige of the
Irish schools continued to draw many students from
England even after the establishment of schools in
their own country; for we find Aldhelm (d. 709
<span class="small">A.D.</span>) writing in a somewhat bitter mood to three
young men who had just returned from the Irish
schools: “Why does Ireland pride herself on such
a priority that such numbers of students look there
from England, as if upon this fruitful soil there were
not abundance of <i>Argivi didasculi</i> (or Greek
masters), to be found fully capable of solving the
deepest problems of religion and satisfying the most
ambitious of students.”<a id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Zimmer looks upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
reluctance of Aldhelm to acknowledge the superiority
of the Irish monastic schools as an additional
testimony in their favour.<a id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>There are some grounds for believing that Alcuin
whose name is intimately connected with the Carolingian
revival of learning studied in Ireland, probably
in Clonmacnoise. Meyer,<a id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Joyce,<a id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> and
Healy,<a id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> do not hesitate to claim him as a student
of Clonmacnoise. Turner<a id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> thinks it more probable
that he was a student of the school of York (in which
case he came under Irish as well as Roman
influence<a id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>) but regards him as representative of
Irish rather than English scholarship. The opinion
that Alcuin studied at Clonmacnoise is based on a
letter<a id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> which is evidently one of a series written by
Alcuin to Colchu (d. 792&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>), Fer-leighinn, or
Headmaster of the school of Clonmacnoise. This
Colchu was a very distinguished scholar and teacher.
There is no evidence that he ever left Ireland, but
his name was well known on the Continent. The
general opinion of his contemporaries was that “no
one in any age or any country was equal to him in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
learning, or equal to him in sanctity.”<a id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> In this
letter, which is of a very cordial nature, Alcuin
styles Colchu his holy father and speaks of himself
as his son. The writer complains that for some
time past he was not deemed worthy to receive any
of those letters so precious in his sight, and concludes
by saying he is sending a messenger with
presents from himself and King Charles (Charlemagne)
to Clonmacnoise and other Irish monasteries.<a id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
Dr. Healy points out that some of these
gifts are of such a nature as to suggest that Alcuin
had a personal knowledge of the needs of Irish
monasteries.<a id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>No doubt, further research would reveal many
other instances of foreign students who sought in
Ireland and there were freely given the education
which was not available in their own lands. In
summarising the conclusions which we believe are
justified by the facts presented in this chapter we
would say:</p>

<p>1. That both the monastic schools and the bardic
schools were so intimately connected with the native
Irish social system that they were not antagonistic
but rather complementary to each other.</p>

<p>2. That these two classes of schools exerted a
mutual influence on each other: the aim of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
monastic schools was frankly religious, yet owing
to the influence of the bardic schools vernacular
learning was not neglected; moreover, as we shall
see later, the monks were led for a variety of reasons
to study the writings of the classical authors; on
the other hand, the bardic schools though mainly
devoted to the cultivation of native learning followed
the example of the monastic schools in introducing
classical learning, thus widening their own
curriculum.</p>

<p>3. That with the abundant facilities thus afforded
there was ample opportunity for everyone who so
desired to acquire liberal education in either a lay
or ecclesiastical school.</p>

<p>4. That though education was not universal nor
compulsory, the great body of the people without
distinction of class or sex was not uneducated.</p>

<p>5. That the educational advantages enjoyed by
the Irish in their native land were as freely extended
to others irrespective of race or country.</p>

<p>6. That the educational influence of the Irish
monastic schools reached Britain and the Continent
in two ways: first, numerous students from foreign
countries who studied in the schools of Ireland
would on returning to their own country naturally
endeavour to transmit the culture they had acquired
during their residence in Ireland; secondly, still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
more important was the influence of the numerous
bands of Irish missionaries who, as we have shown,
established monasteries all over Western Europe
and whose love of learning was equalled only by
their zeal for Christianity.</p>

<p class="subtitle2">CENTRES OF INTELLECTUAL LIFE IN IRISH
MONASTERIES</p>

<p class="noindent">In an Irish monastic school, as in the case of every
other school, the most important centre of intellectual life was the
class-room. Unlike our modern schools, however, these schools had to
produce their own text-books. This work was carried on in a special room
called the scriptorium. The work of the scriptorium was not limited to
the production of text-books. Often valuable books of more permanent
interest were written in the scriptorium and stored for reference in a
special room, the library. In this way copies of many of the most
treasured books of antiquity have been preserved for posterity. Indeed
the educational work of the scriptorium and the library was scarcely
less important than that of the class-room, or school proper. These
three centres of intellectual life were closely related to each other,
but each is sufficiently important to warrant a separate treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE SCHOOL:</h3>

<p>In the last chapter we stated that the <i>aim</i> of the
monastic school was frankly religious. In our next
chapter we hope to prove that in practice this did
not necessarily mean a narrow <i>curriculum</i>. Here
we shall briefly state that the particulars we have
been able to glean on a miscellaneous collection of
topics are of some interest to the educationist. The
data are so few on each topic that the treatment is
necessarily somewhat disconnected. In general
these topics refer to school age, accommodation of
students, school buildings, methods of teaching and
pedagogical principles so far as they are revealed
in the meagre materials to hand.</p>

<p>Seven years was the age at which it was thought
schooling should begin.<a id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> We do not know exactly
what provision was made for young boys of this
tender age, but we know that in case of the older
students a few resided in the school itself, so it is
possible that the younger children also resided in
the school or in the houses of the teachers. Many
of the students lived in the houses of people in the
neighbourhood of the school, but the majority lived
in huts which they built for themselves near the
school. Where the school was a large one these
huts were arranged in streets.<a id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> The poorer
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
students lived in houses with the richer ones whom
they waited upon and served, receiving in return
food, clothing, and other necessities. Some even
chose to live in this matter, not through poverty
but through a self-imposed penance.<a id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>There were no spacious lecture halls; the master
taught and lectured and the pupils studied very
much in the open air, when weather permitted.<a id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
Judging by the large number of monks in every
monastery and recalling the fact that teaching was
regarded as a most meritorious form of labour, we
are inclined to think that there was a great deal
of individual teaching, or at least teaching in small
groups, especially when the weather was unfavourable
for outdoor lectures. This conjecture derives
some support from Bede, who informs us that of the
Anglo-Saxons who went to Ireland many of them
passed from one master’s cell to another for instruction.<a id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<h3>METHODS OF TEACHING:</h3>

<p>In teaching <i>reading</i> it was usual to begin with the
<i>Alphabet</i>. St.&nbsp;Columba’s first alphabet was
written or impressed upon a cake which he afterwards
ate as he played by the side of a stream near
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
his tutor’s home.<a id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Sometimes the alphabet was
engraved upon a large stone.<a id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The Psalms in
Latin seem to have been the earliest subject of instruction.<a id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
As we have seen these were learned by
rote, but judging by the numerous glosses and
annotations<a id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> thereon it is almost certain that the
teachers were not satisfied with mere repetition but
explained the meaning thoroughly.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that the reading of Latin
should be taught before the reading of the vernacular.
The explanation is simple. The Irish
alphabet is based on the Latin (as are the alphabets
of most European languages) and consequently
suits the phonetic system of the Irish language less
perfectly than it does the Latin. Having learned
the alphabet the reading of Latin is comparatively
easy even for young students. At a later stage
when the reading of the vernacular was introduced
progress was no doubt rapid since the student had
merely to associate the written symbols with sounds
that were familiar to him.</p>

<p>The next stage was to teach writing. The
letters were formed on a waxen tablet (<i>polaire</i> in
Irish) with a pointed metal style (<i>graib</i>).<a id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> One of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
these old-time tablets is now in the National
Museum, Dublin.<a id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> The writing on it is in Latin,
apparently a pupil’s class notes.</p>

<p>Joyce thinks that there were no elementary books
for teaching Latin and that the pupil had to face
the difficulties of the language in a rough and ready
manner, beginning right away at the author.<a id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> With
this view we do not agree. There are still extant
numerous vocabularies, paradigms, treatises on
declensions, and several copies of Priscian’s grammatical
tract all in the style of writing practised by
Irish scribes. In such works we have clear evidence
of preparations made to smooth the path for
beginners. Our view is in harmony with the maxim
laid down in the eighth century gloss: “It is the
custom with good teachers (dagforcitlidib) to praise
the understanding of their pupils that <i>they may love
what they hear</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> There is a similar reminder in
another eighth century gloss.<a id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> This quotation is
interesting as showing that oral teaching was
practised, that good teaching was appreciated, that
the methods of good teachers were commended for
imitation and further that the learning process was
to be as pleasant as possible. It would be a mistake
to imagine that the desire to make learning
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
attractive began and ended with the carving of
alphabets on cakes. In the same connection we
may refer to the practice of many eminent teachers
who were wont to compose educational poems embodying
the leading facts of history and other
branches of instruction. A considerable number
of compositions in old Irish MSS. are of this class.
These poems were explained and commented upon
by their authors and learned by rote by the pupils.
Flann of Monasterboice followed this plan and we
still have several of his educational poems on
historical subjects.<a id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>There is a curious geographical poem<a id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> forming
a sort of text-book on general geography which
was used in the school of Ros-Ailithir in Cork of
which the author MacCosse was Principal (Fer-leighinn).
This poem contained practically all
that was then known of the principal countries of
the world. It was written about the beginning of
the tenth century. The tenth century map of the
world drawn in England for an Anglo-Saxon is supposed
to have been the work of an Irish artist.<a id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
Although inaccurate in many particulars this map
is historically interesting as showing the state of
geographical knowledge at this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>In teaching Greek the Irish monks used the
<i>Nermeneumata</i> of the Pseudo-Dositheus, the work
of Macrobius <i>De Differentiis et Societatibus Graeci
Latinique Verbi</i>, Latin glosses and interlinear versions.<a id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
With regard to the Pseudo-Dositheus and
the book of Macrobius, Traube believes that were
it not for the fact that these books were used by
the Irish in teaching Greek both would have been
lost to the afterworld. Mrs. Concannon conjectures
that the earliest teachers of Latin brought
with them to Ireland the third century <i>Disticha
Catonis</i> and used them as materials for teaching as
well as for moral instruction.<a id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> The many copies
of Priscian with numerous glosses thereon would
suggest that this work was extensively used in Irish
monastic schools. Traube has shown conclusively
that the St.&nbsp;Gall copy of Priscian was written by
some friends of Sedulius (of Liège) and supposes
it was copied in some Irish monastery about the
beginning of the ninth century and brought by
Irishmen to the Continent.<a id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> Indeed, the glosses
everywhere furnish objective proofs that the Irish
monks were skilled practical teachers as well as
accomplished classical scholars. In all these interlinear
and marginal notes so abundant in the MSS.
of the Old Irish period (prior to 900&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>) we see
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
clear evidence of preparation for the work of
teaching.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that in the earlier stages of
instruction the pupil was encouraged to ask questions
about the difficulties which he encountered
and the tutor was expected to explain everything
that was obscure to the learner. At a later stage
the learner was questioned to test whether he had
grasped the meaning of what he read, and to raise
difficulties which he was required to explain.<a id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> In
fact the instruction would seem to have been
thorough and in many respects was at least equal
in efficiency, if not in technique, to that imparted
in many of our modern schools. We are told that
it was the special merit of the tutor who obtained
the degree known as <i>Sruth-do-aill</i> that “he was
able to modify his instruction to the complexion of
the information in mercy to the people who were
unable to follow the instruction of a teacher of
higher degree. In other words he was able to
make hard things easy to weak students who might
get frightened in the presence of the formidable
scholar.”<a id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> This would show that the question of
“individual differences” was a live one in pedagogical
circles in those days and that a genuine
attempt was made to solve it. When we come in
a later chapter to discuss the characteristics of the
groups of figures represented on the sculptured
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
crosses we shall see that the value of “visual
instruction” was appreciated.</p>


<h3>THE SCRIPTORIUM:</h3>

<p>The function of the scriptorium was to supply
text-books for the school, service books for the
church and monastic community, and works of a
more general and ambitious nature for the library.
Our knowledge of the internal life of the scriptorium
is unfortunately very limited and is deduced almost
entirely from an examination of the MSS. produced
therein. It would seem that the scriptorium was
not unlike a modern school-room in some respects.
In silence the younger members of the monastic
community and other students sat there writing out
and multiplying books, sometimes from dictation,
sometimes by copying. An invigilator sat there
also to preserve silence and to act as task master.
On the margins of the MSS. we sometimes find
short fragmentary notes devoid of literary value,
but of deep human interest as showing that unregenerate
human nature had its opportunities even
in a monastic scriptorium as much as in a modern
school-room. These notes<a id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> are supposed to be
fragments of conversations carried on <i>sotto voce</i> to
evade the rule of silence and doubtlessly notes were
scribbled surreptitiously to companions. Though
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
all too few these vivid human touches add not a
little to our knowledge of student life in those far
off days.</p>

<p>The scribes made all the <i>writing materials</i>:
tablets, vellum, ink, pens. We have shown that
<i>wax tablets</i> were used in teaching writing. They
were also used in teaching reading, and for such
temporary purposes as taking notes of a sermon or
lecture.<a id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> Adamnan writing in the seventh century
mentions that he inscribed certain writings first on
wax tablets and afterwards on vellum.<a id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> For
memoranda a <i>slate and pencil</i> were also used, as we
learn from the story of Cinnfaela the Learned.
When he was at the school of Tuaim Drecain, now
Tom Regan in Co. Cavan, he wrote down roughly
on slates what he heard during the day, but at night
he transferred the entries into a vellum book.<a id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
These tablets were made of long strips of wood and
covered with beeswax. In shape they were sometimes
like short swords.</p>

<p>The schools prepared their own vellum or parchment
from the skins of goats, sheep, and calves.
This parchment was usually finely polished, but
sometimes it was hard and not well cleaned. The
parchment prepared by the Irish scribes was much
thicker than that used by the French from the
seventh to the tenth century: thus we have an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
additional means whereby we can identify Irish
MSS. on the Continent.<a id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>The ink was made of carbon. It has been found
to resist all the chemical tests for iron. The blackness
of the ink even at the present day is quite
remarkable. The writing of the <i>Book of Armagh</i>,
for instance, is as black as if it were written
yesterday.<a id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>The ink was very likely made of lampblack, or
possibly of fish bone black.<a id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> When we come to
describe the illuminated MSS. which remain to
attest the artistic skill of the monastic scribes we
shall see that not only were they experts at making a
superior quality of ink but, what is still more remarkable,
they manufactured a large variety of pigments
which even at the present day have lost little of
their original brilliancy after a lapse of one thousand
years.</p>


<h3>PENS:</h3>

<p>The beauty, neatness, and perfect uniformity of
the handwriting in old Irish MSS. have led some
antiquarians to express an opinion that the scribes
used metal pens; but such an opinion is quite untenable.
Keller has shown that the pens were made
from the quills of geese, swans, crows, and other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
birds.<a id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> This is also the opinion of Miss Stokes.<a id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
One of the pictures in the <i>Book of Kells</i> confirms
this view. This is a picture representing
St.&nbsp;John the Evangelist engaged in writing the
Gospel. He holds a pen in his hand the feather
of which can be clearly detected.<a id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> The inkstand
is also represented by a slender conical cup fastened
to the corner of the chair on which he is sitting or
upon a stick stuck in the ground.</p>

<p>The old scribes sometimes wrote with the book
resting upon the knees using a flat board for support.
But when writing became more elaborate
and ornamental a desk was used and, if necessary,
a maulstick to support the wrist.<a id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>


<h3>THE SCRIBE:</h3>

<p>In almost every monastery there was at least one
especially expert scribe who was selected partly
because of his scholarship, and partly because of his
skill in penmanship. Outside of the time set apart
for religious exercises the scribe devoted almost his
whole time to the work of copying and multiplying
books. At a time when there were no printed books
we can easily imagine the important part played by
the scribe in the educational life of the monastery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only did the scribes produce the necessary
books for class use, but by their indefatigable
industry they preserved those valuable relics of the
past—a large mass of historical records and
numerous specimens of the literature of ancient
times. To copy a book was considered a highly
meritorious work, especially if it were a part of the
Scriptures, or any other book on sacred or devotional
subjects.<a id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> The scribe was therefore highly
honoured. The Brehon Laws prescribed the same
penalty for the murder of a scribe as for that of an
abbot or bishop and, as we pointed out,<a id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> the Annals
in recording the death of a man otherwise learned
or eminent whether bishop, abbot, priest, or lay
professor considered it an enhancement of his
dignity to add that he was an excellent scribe,
<i>scribhneoir tocchaidhe</i>. The <i>Four Masters</i> record
the obits of 61 eminent scribes before the year 900
<span class="small">A.D.</span> of whom 40 lived between 700 and 800&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>
One has only to glance at some of the MSS. that
have come down to us to realise what excellent penmen
these ancient scribes were. Such skill could
only be acquired after years of careful training. As
will be shown later the scribe was an accomplished
artist as well as an expert penman.</p>


<h3>IRISH SCRIPT:</h3>

<p>The Irish style of writing played an important
part in development not only of the modern Irish
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
hand, but of the style of writing practised for
centuries in England and to some extent on the
Continent also, hence the necessity of giving a brief
account of its history. There is little doubt that
Ireland modelled her national script on the Roman
half-uncial hand, but, as Reeves has pointed out,
the Greek and Roman letters as written by the Irish
scribes mutually affected each other and gave the
Irish alphabet, especially in the capitals that peculiar
form which distinguishes it from all others.<a id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> The
Roman half-uncial hand, however, was the basis
from which the characteristic Irish had developed.
In the words of a recognised authority,<a id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> “The Irish
scribe adopted the Roman half-uncial script and
then with his own innate sense of beauty of form he
produced from it the handsome literary hand which
culminated in the native half-uncial writing as seen
in perfection in the <i>Book of Kells</i> and contemporary
MSS. of the latter part of the seventh century. But
the round half-uncial hand thus formed was too
elaborate for the ordinary uses of life. It was
necessary to produce a script that would serve all
the duties of a current hand. Therefore, taking
the Roman half-uncial hand the Irish scribe adapted
it to commoner uses, and writing the letters more
negligently he evolved the compact, pointed minuscule
hand which became the current form of handwriting
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
of the country and which again in its turn
was in the course of time moulded into the book
hand which superseded the half-uncial.” The
absence of an extraneous influence was an important
factor in aiding the development of a strongly
characteristic national hand which ran its uninterrupted
course down to the late Middle Ages and is
still retained with slight variations in the writing of
Modern Irish. The high degree of cultivation of
Irish writing did not result from the genius of single
individuals, but from the emulation of various
schools of writing and the improvements of several
generations. “There is not a single letter in the
entire alphabet which does not give evidence both
in the general form and in its minutest parts of the
sound judgment and taste of the penman.”<a id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>


<h3>IRISH HAND ABROAD:</h3>

<p>Not only did the Irish perfect this script in the
schools of their native land, but they carried it with
them when they went abroad and taught it in the
schools which they founded in foreign countries.
Owing to the fact that the Irish schools kept up the
tradition of Greek and Latin learning, philologists
and palaeographers have studied the development of
Irish writing very carefully with a view to determining
the dates of classical MSS. which were transcribed
by Irish monks or their pupils. The most
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
important of these studies are those made by
Keller<a id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> and Lindsey.<a id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The work of these scholars
has placed the question of the influence of the Irish
style of writing beyond dispute.</p>

<p>“England borrowed it <i>en bloc</i>; and in the Early
Middle Ages the Irish missionaries who spread over
the continent of Europe and who became the
founders of religious houses carried their native
script with them and taught it to their pupils. Thus
in such centres as Luxeuil in France, Würzburg in
Germany, St.&nbsp;Gall in Switzerland, and Bobbio in
Italy, Irish writing flourished and MSS. in the Irish
hand multiplied. At first there was no difference
between the writing in these MSS. and that in the
Irish codices actually written in Ireland. But as
might be expected the script thus employed in
isolated foreign places gradually deteriorated as the
bonds with the native hand relaxed and the Irish
monks died off.”<a id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> From these MSS. written in
the characteristic Irish script we are able to form
some idea, though an inadequate one, of the magnitude
and importance of the work done by the Irish
monks in preserving the ancient classics. Moreover,
in addition to those MSS. described as
<i>Scottice Scripta</i> by continental librarians, Zimmer
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
has shown that many of the MSS. ostensibly the
work of the continental scholars are in reality the
work of Irish monks.<a id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> The explanation is that
those monks who studied on the Continent tried as
far as possible to accustom themselves to the forms
of the letters used by continental scholars. For
instance, this is the case of all the documents
written by Moengal at St.&nbsp;Gall between the years
853–860&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span><a id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>


<h3>LIBRARIES:</h3>

<p>An important feature of every monastic school
was the library, or <i>tech screptra</i>, as it is styled in
the older Irish MSS. When we recall the fame of
these schools, the needs of the students, and the
number of scribes whose business it was to cater
to these needs we might reasonably infer that these
libraries were provided with text-books and with
books for general reading. These libraries differed
widely from our modern libraries. There were no
shelves for rows of books, but there was another
arrangement which was more suitable for the type
of book then in use. The books were kept in
satchels hung on pegs or racks round the room.
Each satchel containing one or more volumes was
labelled on the outside. The satchels were of
embossed leather beautifully adorned with designs
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of interlaced ornament so common in Irish art.
Many specimens of these satchels are on view in
the National Museum, Dublin, and there is one in
Corpus Christi College, Oxford.<a id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> These satchels
were also used when carrying a book from place to
place.</p>

<p>The book itself was of parchment. Manuscripts
which were greatly valued were usually kept in
elaborately embossed leather covers of which two
are still preserved, namely, the cover of the <i>Book of
Armagh</i>,<a id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> and that of the Shrine of St.&nbsp;Maidoc.<a id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>Books abounded in Ireland when the Danes made
their appearance there about the end of the eighth
century; hence the pride with which the old writers
referred to “the hosts of the books of Erin.” But
with the first Danish incursions began an era of
burning and pillaging the monasteries and consequently
a woeful destruction of MSS., the records
of the ancient learning. The special fury of the
invaders appears to have been directed against
books, monasteries, and monuments of religion.
All the books they could lay hands upon they either
burned or “drowned” by throwing them into the
nearest river, or lake. For two centuries this
wanton destruction continued, and ceased only
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
when the Danes were finally crushed at the Battle
of Clontarf in 1014&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span><a id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>During the Danish period missionaries and
scholars who went abroad carried with them great
numbers of MSS. As a result of the exportation as
well as of the destruction of MSS. we can merely
conjecture as to the extent and value of the books
in a library attached to a great Irish monastic
school during the period covered by our investigation.
Fortunately, however, we are able to
describe the contents of the libraries of the Irish
establishment of St.&nbsp;Gall in Switzerland, and
Bobbio in Italy, and this may serve to give us some
idea of the wealth of material the Irish libraries
once possessed, but most of it is now irreparably
lost.</p>

<p>A catalogue of the Bobbio library was made
between the years 967–972&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> It is attributed
to the Abbot Gerbert who afterwards became Pope
Silvester II.<a id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> At this time the library contained
about 700 volumes,<a id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> of which 479 had been
acquired gradually from various unstated sources,
and over 220 had been presented by scholars who
are named with the list of books they had given,<a id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
43 having been a donation from the famous Irish
monk Dungal who presided over the school of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Pavia.<a id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> This catalogue itself is strong objective
evidence for the claim we are making that the
classical authors were read. The list of MSS.
shows that both Greek and Latin classics, were well
represented. Among others we find works by the
following authors: Terence, Lucretius, Virgil,
Ovid, Lucian, Martial, Juvenal, Claudian, Cicero,
Seneca, and the Elder Pliny;<a id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> also Persius,
Flaccus, Horace, Demosthenes, and Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>The greater part of the Bobbio collection has
been dispersed through the libraries of Rome,
Milan, Naples, and Vienna.<a id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> It is practically
certain that the Ambrosian palimpsest of Plautus
and those of several of Cicero’s orations and of the
letters of Fronto discovered in the Ambrosian
Library (Milan) early in the ninth century all came
from the monastery founded by the Irish monk of
Bobbio.<a id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Among other MSS. which once belonged
to Bobbio may be mentioned fragments of Symmachus
(in Milan) and the Theodosian Code
(formerly in Turin), Scholia on Cicero (v. century)
MSS. of St.&nbsp;Luke (v.–vi. cent.), St.&nbsp;Severinus
(vi. cent.), Josephus (vi.–vii.), Gregory’s Dialogue
(c. 750) and St.&nbsp;Isadore’s (before 840). Last
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
but not least we must mention the “Muratori
Fragment” (viii. cent., or earlier), the earliest
extant list of Books of the New Testament.<a id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>St.&nbsp;Agilius (St.&nbsp;Aile), a pupil of St.&nbsp;Columbanus
the founder of Bobbio, was first abbot of the
monastery founded at Resbacus (Rébais, east of
Paris) in 634&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span><a id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> The MSS. copied there included
the works of Terence, Cicero, Virgil,
Horace, Donatus, Priscian and Boethius.<a id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>The libraries of the Irish monasteries of Würzburg
and Reichau seem to have been large and
important. Many existing Irish MSS. come from
these two monasteries. Unfortunately, no old
catalogue of the Würzburg collection seems to have
come down to us. In the case of Reichau (Augia
Major) on Lake Constance a catalogue was made
while Erlebald was abbot between 822 and 838&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>
The number of MSS. given in this catalogue is 415
of which 30 were written in Erlebald’s time.<a id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>Important though the collections of Rébais,
Würzburg and Reichau undoubtedly were they are
overshadowed by the greater fame of Bobbio.
Indeed there is only one library that could compare
with Bobbio either for the extent or the value of its
MSS., and that was the library of St.&nbsp;Gall or
Sangallen in Switzerland. This great monastery
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
was founded by St.&nbsp;Gall (in Irish Cellach), the
pupil and companion of St.&nbsp;Columbanus, about the
year of 612&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> In the ninth century the library
of St.&nbsp;Gall possessed 533 volumes, nine of them
being palimpsests.<a id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> This library was famous
during the Middle Ages. The Fathers who attended
the Council of Constance depended mainly
for reference on the valuable MSS. in this library
to which they had free access; and, sad to relate,
when the Council broke up in 1418&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> many of
these holy men neglected to return these valuable
old theological works in Latin and Greek.<a id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> This
same library came to another loss two years earlier,
in 1416, when Poggio, the Florentine scholar, with
two learned friends who had been engaged at the
Council visited St.&nbsp;Gall. Having a season of
leisure they made a search for some missing volumes
of Cicero, Livy, and other classical writers.
Nor were they disappointed. Among other
precious tomes they discovered the well-known
<i>Argonauticon</i> of Flaccus, copies of eight of
Cicero’s orations with valuable commentaries by
Asconius Pedianus, the works of the Roman
architect Vitruvius, also the works of Priscian, of
Quintilian, of Lucretius, and of other great
scholars.<a id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>In many libraries of Europe there are MSS.
written, or copied, by Irish monks during the
seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries. These MSS.
are bound together into Codices which are named
either after the principal work included therein, or
after the monastery where they were written, or
sometimes from the library where they are at
present deposited. These Codices contain copies
of the classics, treatises on grammar, the Psalms,
the Epistles of St Paul, and other portions of the
Scriptures, Lives of the Saints, Hymns, Bede’s
Ecclesiastical History of England, &amp;c. Scribes
when studying these often added glosses and
scholia either on the margin or between the lines
to explain the Latin and Greek words of the text.
Sometimes as in the case of the Psalms and of
Priscian’s grammatical tract these glosses were
copious and show that the scribe had availed himself
freely of the work of earlier commentators.
These glosses have been a rich mine to students of
philology and have been extensively used for
linguistic purposes containing as they do many of
the most archaic forms of the Irish language. The
meaning of these Old Irish words can now be
obtained from the Greek and Latin words which
were originally explained by the Irish words. Some
of these MSS. were written by Irishmen on the
Continent, while others were written in Ireland and
carried to the Continent by other monks who
deposited them in the libraries of their monasteries.</p>

<p>These numerous and valuable MSS. that have
come down to us are in themselves the most convincing
evidence of the zeal of the Irish monks for
the promotion and transmission of classical learning.
There can be little doubt that these Irish
scholars under the most adverse circumstances
fostered learning during the dark ages that preceded
the Renaissance and, as we have seen, when
the great awakening came one of the sources from
which the treasures of classical antiquity emerged
were the monastic libraries that contained the MSS.
copied, or preserved, with loving care by Irish
scribes and scholars.</p>

<p>In this chapter we have endeavoured to show
how the zeal for learning which inspired the teacher
in the class-room was carried into the scriptorium;
how the scribes with patient industry copied, and
so transmitted, the relics of classical antiquity; and
how these relics were preserved to the afterworld
in the great monastic libraries. The direct contribution
made by the Irish monks of the Early
Middle Ages to contemporary education will be
studied in the next chapter. Here we would
emphasise the fact that the full significance of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Irish monastic schools as an educational factor cannot
be understood unless we realize the importance
of the combined, as well as the separate, contribution
of these three great centres of intellectual
activity, the school, the scriptorium and the library.</p>

<p class="subtitle2">COURSE OF STUDIES</p>

<p>Perhaps the question of greatest interest to the
student of the history of Education of the Early
Middle Ages is the character of curriculum taught
in the Irish Monastic Schools during the period
under investigation. Most writers have conveniently
avoided all reference to this question or
they have contented themselves with vague
generalizations which may mean much or little in
proportion to the reader’s own familiarity with the
history of the period. We are told, for example,
that the Irish monks were possessors of a higher
culture than was found elsewhere in Europe and
that they taught all the knowledge of their time.
Such statements are not particularly helpful. Dr.
Joyce, however, has tried to be more explicit.
Utilising the materials brought to light through the
publication of the Brehon Laws and availing himself
of the researches of O’Curry and other Irish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
scholars, he has compiled<a id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> two Tables of Degrees
and Subjects of Study. In the first he gives the
courses of study for Monastic and Bardic Schools
in parallel columns. This course appears to have
been carefully graded and extends over a period of
twelve years. The second table is quite different
from the first. It is designated the “Seven
Grades or Orders of Wisdom.” The former
scheme would seem to have the students in view
while the latter has reference mainly to the professors
or teachers of whom three of the lower
grades, or orders, were themselves learners. This
shows that in the Irish schools the functions of
teaching and learning were closely related, and it
often happened that the same person was at one
time under instruction of the professors in the
grades above him while at another time he was
employed in teaching junior scholars.</p>

<p>From an examination of these two schemes we
feel justified in drawing the following conclusions:</p>


<p>1. That the scheme of education was carefully
graduated and extended over a period of several
years, probably from 7 to 26 years in the case of
monastic students and from 7 to 30 years for lay
students.</p>


<p>2. The lay or bardic studies were limited
originally to native secular learning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>3. That the monastic course included both
secular and religious studies, that both Latin and
the vernacular were used as a medium of instruction,
and that the study of native literature was not
neglected.</p>


<p>4. That in the monastic school special attention
was given to the study of the Sacred Scriptures—both
the Old and the New Testament.</p>


<p>5. That there would appear to have been more
rote memory work in the Bardic than in the
Monastic school.</p>


<p>6. That there was frequent questioning and
explanation in the Monastic school.</p>


<p>7. That the degree of Ollamh or Doctor was
reserved for those whose learning was profound.
That this great scholar was entitled to the highest
honour: when he visited the palace he had the
privilege of sitting in the banqueting-house with the
king.</p>


<p>While we believe the above conclusions fully
warranted, we confess that many of the terms used
in both schemes are either so vague or so obscure
that we do not feel satisfied that an adequate idea
of the course of study in the Irish monastic schools
can be derived from this source. We propose to
supplement Dr. Joyce’s helpful but rather meagre
account by many additional facts which have been
gleaned from an examination of the acknowledged
works of Irish writers of this period and such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
references as are met with in the works of other
writers.</p>

<p>We hope to show that the curriculum was a
comparatively broad one, including not only the
study of the Sacred Scriptures with the commentaries
of the Greek and Latin Fathers, but also the
study of the pagan authors of Greece and Rome.
Nor was the study of the Irish language and
literature neglected. Science in the modern sense
of the word was unknown, but as regards
Geography, Computation, and Astronomy the
Irish Monastic Schools were quite as far
advanced as any in Europe and certainly far
ahead of their neighbours. At least in the ninth
century philosophy and dialectic were eagerly
studied. We shall have a word to say about the
Irish school of church music. Art too flourished,
especially the illumination of manuscripts, various
ornamental forms of metal work and stone-carving.</p>

<p>No doubt the primary aim of the Irish monastic
school was the teaching and study of Christian
theology, but just as Christianity itself did not mean
the abolition but rather the fulfilment of Hebrew
ideals and traditions, so when Christianity was introduced
into Ireland where an ancient native
culture was flourishing the new culture did not displace
the old but rather combined with it to form
a new type of culture which in course of time became
at once both Irish and Christian. In the
schools everything that was not absolutely opposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
to the ideals of Christianity was utilised to enrich
the course of study. Thus the native laws, literature,
music and art became the handmaid of
Christianity. The same liberal and enlightened
conception of education would explain the success
with which the Irish monks pursued the study of
the pagan classics. The literary taste already
acquired through a study of native literature was
entirely favourable to the appreciation and enjoyment
of the great authors of antiquity. Besides
the Christianity of the Irish monk was sufficiently
robust to prevent any of those scruples of conscience
which were said to have haunted the continental
monk who loved his Virgil.<a id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Indeed the
stories in the classics about gods and goddesses
would be regarded by the Irish purely from a
literary and artistic standpoint and could have little
religious significance for them since there was little
in common between the paganism of Greece and
Rome and such remnants of paganism as still
survived in Ireland. On the Continent the case
was different, hence the suspicion with which
continental ecclesiastics regarded the study of writings
other than those of the Fathers and as they
were ignorant of Greek they had to confine themselves
solely to the Latin Fathers. Not so the
Irish monks as we shall see later. Moreover, the
anxiety to obtain more perfect copies of the Scriptures
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
was an additional and perhaps more powerful
incentive to the Irish monk to make himself familiar
with the classical forms of Greek and Latin.</p>

<p>If this is a correct interpretation of the educational
situation confronting the Irish monastic
schools—and the evidence we shall produce is overwhelming—then
we shall see how unwarranted is
the statement of a recent writer<a id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> that the learning
of the Irish was wholly psalm-singing and theology—not
the classics; and that the <i>maiora studia</i>
referred to by Bede meant the Scriptures,—not
philosophy and literature.</p>


<h3>STUDY OF THE SCRIPTURES:</h3>

<p>We admit that the Scriptures were the great, but
by no means the only, subject of study.<a id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> As early
as the fifth century the Irish poet Sedulius wrote
his <i>Carmen Pascale</i> in which he recounts the chief
events of the Old and New Testament giving us
“the first Christian epic worthy of the name.”<a id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
The Psalms were learned by rote.<a id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> The <i>Book of
Armagh</i> written by an Irish scribe and finished in
807&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> contains the only complete copy of the
New Testament which has come down from the
days of the Celtic Church.<a id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> The Old Testament
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
must have been well known judging from the many
existing fragments with glosses and scholia thereon
in the handwriting of Irish scribes,<a id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> not to speak of
commentaries like that of Aileran The Wise (d. 665
<span class="small">A.D.</span>)<a id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> and innumerable Scriptural references in the
religious literature of Ireland which is written both
in the Gaelic and Latin languages. Indeed so
famous were the Irish monastic schools for Scriptural
studies that one of the causes which drew
foreigners to the Irish schools was the prospect of
reading the Sacred Writings in the MSS. so
abundantly furnished through the untiring industry
of the Irish scribes. Among the more noteworthy
visitors who came for this purpose was Agilbert,
a native of Gaul, who came in 650&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> to Ireland
where “he sojourned some time and read the
Scriptures.”<a id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> On his return he became bishop of
the West Saxons, and later occupied the episcopal
see of Paris.<a id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> The Angle Egbert also spent some
time in Ireland “as an exile for Christ that he
might study the Scriptures.”<a id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>The religious education of the Irish monastery
was not confined to the singing of hymns and the
recitation of psalms as has been asserted. Indeed
such exercises formed but a minor part in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
monastic scheme. The monks had advanced beyond
this elementary stage long before they came
to the larger schools.<a id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> The sacred reading consisted
in the study and interpretation of the Bible.<a id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
Their aim was to search for the spiritual sense and
message of the great Book. The higher criticism
of these days was then unknown. The investigation
of the question of more or less enlightening
dates, the details regarding natural life and environment,
as well as questions of authorship, the history
of particular books, as also all discussion of
linguistic and literary form were matters that were
wisely left to later times. In the <i>Interpretatio
mystica progenitorum Christi</i><a id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> of Aileran we have
an interesting example of a style of commentary
which must have been usual in the Irish schools of
the seventh century. Aileran quotes not only St.
Jerome and St.&nbsp;Augustine but what is more
remarkable he cites Origen, the great genius of the
Alexandrine school as well as Philo, the Alexandrine
Jew.<a id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Aileran was not the only Irish monk of the
seventh century who showed ability and diligence in
research. We have a still more striking example
in the case of Cummian Fada (d. 661). Cummian
flourished during the years of the Paschal controversy.
About the year 630&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> a National Synod
was held to discuss the advisability of adopting the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Roman method of calculating Easter. There was
a sharp difference of opinion and owing to insufficiency
of information it was necessary to suspend
judgment. Cummian was requested to investigate
the matter. He tells us how he retired for a whole
year into the sanctuary of sacred study to examine
as best he could the testimonies of the Scriptures,
the facts of history, and the nature of the various
cycles in use. The results of his year’s study he
sums up in his Epistle.<a id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> He quotes St.&nbsp;Augustine,
St.&nbsp;Jerome, St.&nbsp;Cyprian and St.&nbsp;Gregory on the
unity of the Church. He then refers to the cycles
of Anatolius, Theophilus, Dionysius, Cyril,
Morinus, Augustine, Victorius, and Pachomius.<a id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
In other words his researches showed a wonderful
familiarity with the whole subject. In other fields,
too, an astonishing range of reading is noticeable;
for example, Aengus in his Felire<a id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> written about
800&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> cites Jerome, Ambrose and Eusebius as
well as “the countless hosts of the illuminated
books of Erin.” These examples would at least
go to show that the Irish monks had an intimate
acquaintance with the writings of the Latin and
Greek Fathers but it still remains to be shown that
the pagan classical authors were studied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<h3>STUDY OF THE LATIN CLASSICAL AUTHORS:</h3>

<p>We have three sources of evidence that the writings
of the great classical writers were not neglected
as has sometimes been asserted. These sources
are: 1, the numerous works of classical authors
which have been copied and preserved in the Irish
monastic libraries especially those of St.&nbsp;Gall in
Switzerland and Bobbio in Italy; 2, the marginal
and interlinear glosses on various MSS. earlier than
the tenth century; 3, the quotations and imitations
of classical writers which are revealed by study of
the actual writing of early Irish mediæval writers.</p>

<p>In the section of Chapter V dealing with Irish
libraries we discussed fully the first source of evidence
and pointed out the influence of these
libraries in late mediæval times. In more than one
instance we had occasion to refer to the glosses as
exemplifying different phases of intellectual activity
in the Irish monastic school. Here we would
emphasise the fact that these glosses furnish another
objective proof that the Irish monks studied
and taught the classics as well as the writings of
the Fathers. There is considerable variety in the
glosses. Generally they are in the nature of
explanations written usually in Irish or Latin but
occasionally in Greek. They consist mainly of
explanations of obscure passages. They give
various historical, mythological, and archæological
details. They contain definitions, translations of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
individual words, free translations of idiomatic
expressions, illustrations of the correct use of certain
words, a summary of the observations of
previous commentators and an elucidation of
obscure allusions. In short they contain all that
varied and supplementary matter which is essential
when making an intensive study of a difficult book.
These notes were at once grammatical and encyclopædic.<a id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>A good example of this kind of work occurs in
the <i>Codex Sangallensis</i> containing one of the many
copies of Priscian’s Grammar which were written
by Irish scribes. Traube has shown that it was
written by some of the friends of Sedulius (of
Liège) and supposes that it was copied in some
Irish monastery and brought by wandering Irishmen
to the Continent. The text is in different
hands. The glosses too are in different hands
from those which wrote the Latin text. At least
three different hands are distinguished. The
authorities relied upon by the glossators are:
Origen, Isidore, Jerome, Augustine, Gregory,
Hilary, Primascius, Virgilius, Ambrosius, Boethius,
Cassianus, Dionysius, Thrax, Gaudentius, Baeda,
Orascius, Cicero (not the orator, but an obscure
grammarian), Hieronymus, Lactantius, Maximianus,
Papirinus, Polibius, Medicus, and Probus.<a id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>The very fact of being familiar with such an array
of grammarians and authors is enough to justify
Sedulius (at Liège 840–860&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>) in describing
himself and his fellow-countrymen as <i>docti grammatici</i>.<a id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
One of them wrote a treatise on the Art
of Versification, <i>Tractus de Metrica Ratione</i>,<a id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
which Zimmer styles a grammatical treatise of
importance.<a id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Clement (d. 826&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>) who succeeded
Alcuin as Instructor to the Imperial Court of Charles
the Great,<a id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> <i>magister palatinus</i> as he was called,
wrote a grammatical work<a id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> which is famous for its
erudition and for the wide range of reading which
it shows, especially interesting is his reference to the
Greeks “who are our masters in all branches of
learning.”<a id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>These grammatical treatises were much more
than books on formal grammar. They dealt
with the principles of rhetoric and the art of versification
and when enriched by commentaries they
must have occupied a prominent place in the educational
literature of their own as well as of the
succeeding centuries; for we should remember that
in those days scholars were inclined to supplement
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
existing works by adding commentaries rather than
to attempt anything along original lines. However,
many of the Irish monks were accomplished
scholars and authors as well as commentators. In
this connection many names might be cited, one of
the most versatile being Sedulius who taught at
Liège from 840 to 860&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span><a id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Besides writing
commentaries on the Scriptures, a grammatical
treatise, and a work on the theory of government,
he composed numerous poems of much merit.<a id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
With Sedulius we might rank Donatus (824–874
<span class="small">A.D.</span>), bishop of Fiesole, who was also a poet.
Among his poems there is one in which he gives a
beautiful description of Ireland and shows that he
has a high ideal of the mission of his race. He
describes himself as <i>Scottorum sangine creatus</i> and
tells how he united the duties of bishop to those of
teacher of grammar and poetry.<a id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>Such varied activities as copying and glossing
the writings of classical authors, teaching poetry,
and writing treatises on grammar are sufficient to
suggest that the literary interests of the Irish
monks extended beyond psalm-singing and a study
of the writings of the Fathers. Even if their
primary interest was the study of the Scriptures
this very interest created a need for an abundance
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
of correct texts. This naturally led to a careful
study of orthography and the production of treatises
on grammar in the broad sense in which we have
defined the term. Possibly at first the rudiments
of grammar were all that was necessary, but as Mr.
Roger so aptly remarks,<a id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> “l’émulation créée par
l’expansion du monachisme, la hardiesse et la
curiosité naturelles des Irlandais, le désir d’approcher
de plus en plus la pensée divine en pénétrant le sens
d’Écriture, le goût pour l’étude qui n’était pas une
nouveauté en Irlande, les entraînent au delà de ces
éléments.” Thus having surmounted preliminary
difficulties it was but natural that they whose literary
taste had been developed by the study of their vernacular
literature should not hesitate to study the
classical authors. There was no fear of the return
of paganism; to the Irish the Greek and Latin
deities made no appeal. As they were not likely to
sacrifice their faith to pagan rhetoric there was no
necessity to confine themselves to rustic Latin as
was the custom with the early Christians on the
Continent who were daily drawing farther and
farther away from correct classical forms. Hence
<i>a priori</i> there are many reasons why we should
expect to find traces of the classics in the writings
of the Irish monks. This view is confirmed by an
actual analysis of the existing works of writers of
this period.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>
<p>In the case of the prose works which we have
mentioned the more or less technical nature of the
subject did not afford scope for the cultivation of a
classical style. What was essential was a lucid
exposition of the thought-content expressed in
clear, correct, intelligible language and this they
undoubtedly possessed.<a id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>With poetry, however, the case was different.
Here naturally enough we find clear traces of
the influence of the classical poets, and even in the
prose of Irish scholars this same influence is often
noticeable. Virgil in particular would appear to
have been a special favourite. In this connection
it is significant to find Old Irish seventh century
glosses on the scholia of Iunius Philargyrius on the
Bucolics.<a id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Adamnan (624–704&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>) knew Virgil
well. In his <i>Vita Sancti Columbae</i>, as Reeves has
pointed out, there is clear evidence that he was
familiar with the Georgics.<a id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> Roger has found
traces of both the Georgics and the Aeneid as well
as allusions to the authors Plautus and Suetonius.<a id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
Indeed it has been rigorously established that the
extracts from Philargyrius already referred to are
the work of no other than Adamnan himself.<a id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>Muirchu who wrote the <i>Memoirs of St.&nbsp;Patrick</i>, in
obedience to the command of Bishop Aed of Sletty
(d. 698&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>) was inspired by Virgil and perhaps by
Apollonius of Rhodes.<a id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> Columbanus (540–615
<span class="small">A.D.</span>) was in many ways the most striking figure
of his time. We have referred to the success of his
missionary work.<a id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> As a classical scholar he was
no less remarkable. He did not arrive on the Continent
until he was fifty<a id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> years old and as his life
there was filled with missionary work his scholarship
must be considered as representative of the
Bangor school where he spent so many years of his
life as a student and a teacher. Columbanus
arrived in Gaul about twenty years before the death
of Gregory of Tours. But, as a distinguished
French author remarks, it is sufficient to glance at
the writings of Columbanus to recognise immediately
their marvellous superiority over those of
Gregory, or of the Gallo-Romans of his time.<a id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> He
wrote an ode in Adonic verse which abounds in apt
classical allusions.<a id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> In his poetry he imitated or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
cited Horace and Virgil and he has at least one
quotation from the satires of Juvenal. Gundlach
who submitted both the prose writings and the
poetical Epistolae of Columbanus to a careful investigation,
discovered in them quotations from, or
reminiscences of, Persius, Virgil, Horace, Sallust,
Ovid, Juvenal, as well as of the Christian poets
Juvencus, Prudentius and Ausonius.<a id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> The familiarity
with the writings of the classical authors so noticeable
in the case of Columbanus is by no means an
isolated phenomenon. A period spent in a continental
library in exploring the collection of
mediæval MSS. seldom fails to be rewarded by the
discovery of additional writings of Irish scholars.<a id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
Thus in recent years Traube found in a MS. in
Florence verses<a id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> composed by an abbot named
Cellanus who has been identified with Cellach or
Cellanus, the abbot of Peronne who succeeded
Ultan, the brother of St.&nbsp;Fursey. Cellanus (d. 706
<span class="small">A.D.</span>) is supposed to be the anonymous monk who
wrote a letter to Aldhelm in which the educational
influence of Irish scholars in England is referred
to.<a id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> Cellanus, like his contemporary Adamnan, is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
familiar with Virgil;<a id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> while Cadoc, a student of
Lismore, is said to have known Virgil by rote.<a id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>We might give many more instances showing the
continuity of Irish classical scholarship during the
sixth, seventh and eighth centuries, but enough
have been given to appreciate the tribute of Kerr
when he says:<a id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> “The Latin education in Ireland
began earlier and was better maintained than in
other countries. The English and Teutonic nations
received instruction from the Irish, and that not
only at the beginning of their studies: Irish learning
did not exhaust itself in missionary work and
was not merged in the progress of its German
pupils; it kept its vivifying power through many
generations, and repeated in the ninth century the
good works of the fifth, again contributing fresh
material and a still rarer spirit of inquiry to the
common erudition of the Continent.”</p>

<p>That the classical learning carried back into
Gaul by the Irish monks did not immediately produce
any very encouraging results can be largely
accounted for by the disturbed social conditions.
The rivalries and weakness of the Merovingian
kings prolonged the period of disorder and violence.
Besides, according to Jonas,<a id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> the negligence of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
bishops consequent on the troubled situation was
as culpable as the frequency of wars for the decay
of religion. Hence the activities of the Irish monks
were naturally directed partly at least into other
channels in trying to bring about a reform in the
morals of the people. To quote Roger:<a id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> “Tandis
que saint Benoît trace, avec sérénité, un plan complet
de la vie monastique, saint Columban oppose
a la violence des vices, dans une société corrompue,
la violence dans la penitence; il trace un plan
d’attaque où il met toute la fouge de son caractère.
La vertu de la religion était presque abolie; il
s’efforce de la ranimer et de rendre à la foi
l’efficacité qu’elle avait perdue.”</p>

<p>Under the enlightened policy of Charlemagne
there was a distinct improvement in the social condition
of the people, but the part played by the Irish
monks during the seventh and eighth centuries in
helping to bring about the moral regeneration of
the people must not be overlooked; for even
though this aspect of their work lies outside our
present study, we cannot completely ignore those
social factors which delayed the realization of a
literary renaissance until the ninth century.
Whether or not the efforts of Charlemagne
“resulted in a revival of learning far more important
in its consequences than that which is
known as <i>the</i> Renaissance”<a id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> it can no longer be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
questioned that “during the reign of Charlemagne
and his immediate successors the chief share of the
literary revival which belongs to that period and is
known as the Carolingian Renaissance fell to the
Irish teachers in Frankland, and if we except
Alcuin, Rhabanus and Fredegis, the men who
founded that educational system to which the latter
Middle Ages owe everything and the modern world
more than it generally acknowledges were Irishmen.”<a id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>


<h3>STUDY OF GREEK IN EARLY MEDIÆVAL IRELAND:</h3>

<p>Having shown that there was an unbroken
tradition of classical Latin learning in early mediæval
Ireland, having examined the scope and
character of that learning and noted its influence
in the history of European education, we may
fittingly examine the position which Greek occupied
in the curriculum of Irish monastic schools. The
traditional belief that the study of Greek was pursued
in these schools cannot be accepted without
investigation in view of the doubts raised by such
scholars as Manitius, Roger, and Esposito in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
recent years.<a id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> The most important objection raised
by these writers is that the evidence is insufficient
to justify the claim that the Irish schools possessed
a knowledge of Greek prior to the ninth century.
Even in the ninth century Esposito will allow the
Irish schools no credit for Greek scholarship.
According to this writer men like Johannes Scottus
Eriugena learned Greek from the books which they
found on the Continent, especially in Gaul. We
might retort that these assertions require more
proof than has been advanced on their behalf, that
these conclusions derive no support from the
authorities adduced by Esposito as evidence, and
that the views expressed by him are contradicted
by the contemporary evidence contained in the well-known
passage from Eric the Auxerre.<a id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>We believe, however, that the knowledge of
Greek for which the Irish schools have been given
credit can be established to the satisfaction of the
unbiased, just as we have demonstrated the fact
that classical Latin was cultivated. In attempting
to prove that Greek studies were pursued we are
confronted with a difficulty which we did not
encounter in our investigation of the question of
classical Latin. An examination of the actual writings
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of Irish scholars who flourished during the
sixth, seventh and eighth centuries revealed
numerous quotations from, and reminiscences of
classical Latin authors, thus we had incontestable
evidence of an intimate acquaintance with classical
Latin. In studying Greek the aim was not, as in
case of Latin, to acquire a new medium of expression,
consequently its study would be conducted on
different lines. The necessity for such a knowledge
existed nevertheless. The great object of study
being the Scriptures,<a id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> the aim of the whole course
of study was to prepare men’s minds for the “Lectio
Divina,” their one great science to which all the
other “disciplinae” were but auxiliaries. It is
therefore but reasonable to suppose that the Irish
monks were impelled towards a study of Greek, a
knowledge of which was so necessary in studying
the Scriptures. This view is corroborated by an
examination of native Irish sources. Thus Dallan
Forgal in his eulogy of Colmcille (composed c. 576
<span class="small">A.D.</span>) says: “Atgaill grammataig greic,” that is,
“he taught Greek Grammar.”<a id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> The early
glossaries swarm with Greek words quoted for
etymological purposes.<a id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> The hymns in the
<i>Antiphonary</i> of Bangor contain numerous Greek
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
words.<a id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> Indeed, the charms of the Greek language
had such a fascination for Irish writers that many
of them had developed a pedantic turn as early as
the seventh century.<a id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> Zimmer has pointed out
the Greek of these early writers was not merely
bookish learning but a living speech.<a id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> Meyer’s
tabulation of the peculiarities in the transcription of
Greek as practised by Irish writers confirms the
accuracy of Zimmer’s observation.<a id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> We are
informed that a Greek taught Mosinu MacCuimin
“the art of computation.”<a id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> Keller gives numerous
examples of Hiberno-Greek characters.<a id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> In an
eighth century MS. of Adamnan’s <i>Vita Sancti
Columbae</i> there are many instances which suggest
that the Greek and Roman characters, as written
by the Irish scribes, mutually affected each other
and gave the Irish alphabet especially in the
capitals that peculiar character which distinguishes
it from all others.<a id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> In the <i>Book of Armagh</i>
written about 807&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> there are several Greek
words and the Lord’s Prayer is written in Greek
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
characters.<a id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> In the glosses on Priscian’s Grammar
Greek words and phrases are explained by Irish
equivalents and we note a familiarity with the rules
of Greek grammar.<a id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> The most remarkable evidence
is that of Aldhelm<a id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> who in a letter to Eahfrid
fresh from the Irish schools finds fault with him for
having gone to the “didasculi Argivi” of that
country instead of staying in England where Theodore
of Tarsus and Hadrian of Nisida<a id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> had introduced
Greek studies. It is significant that this
letter of Aldhelm’s abounds in Hellenisms to a
greater extent than any of his other writings, his
object being apparently to impress Eahfrid with the
Greek learning to be obtained in England.</p>

<p>We have referred to a common practice of the
Irish monks, viz., the making of marginal and interlinear
glosses in which were explained Latin, Greek
and even sometimes Hebrew words and expressions
by Irish equivalents. They also compiled lists of
Irish words which were considered difficult or
obsolete at the time the glosses were written.
These words were explained by giving their
more modern equivalents. Frequently the meaning
was given in Latin and Greek also. The
most famous glosses of this class are Cormac’s<a id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and O’Mulconry’s glosses.<a id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> Dr. Hyde describes<a id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>
Cormac’s glossary “as by far the oldest attempt<a id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
at a comparative vernacular dictionary made in any
language of modern Europe. The king-bishop
(Cormac, d. 903&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>) was a most remarkable man
and an excellent scholar. He appears to have
known Latin, Greek, Hebrew and Danish and to
have been one of the finest old Gaelic scholars of
his day and withal an accomplished poet.” In
the library of St.&nbsp;Paul in Lavanthale (Steyermark)
there is a MS. full of extracts written by an Irish
monk. It contains Irish poems of the eighth
century, Latin hymns, the commencement of a
commentary on Virgil, a treatise on astronomy,
<i>Greek declensions and paradigms as well as a Greek
vocabulary</i>.<a id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> The Greek Creed was sung in the
churches of St.&nbsp;Gallen.<a id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> Under the title <i>Proverbia
Graecorum</i> there is a collection of sayings
translated by some Irish scholar from Greek into
Latin before the seventh century.<a id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> In the eighth
century Boniface brings Clement the Irishman to
task for not accepting the teaching of the Latin
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Fathers Jerome, Augustine and Gregory, just as
a century later Scottus Eriugena was charged with
being inclined too much to the Greek Fathers and
with under-rating the Latin Fathers.<a id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> In the
library of Laon there is a MS. written by an Irish
scribe between the years 850–900&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> This MS.
contains two glossaries in the Greek and Latin
languages with occasional passages in the Irish
language. It also contains a Greek grammar.<a id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> It
is believed that the <i>Hermeneumata</i> of the Pseudo-Dositheus,
a text used by Roman boys in studying
Greek, as well as the work of Macrobius were only
saved for the afterworld because they were used by
the Irish.<a id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> The interlinear Latin versions of Greek
texts are of exclusively Irish origin.<a id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> In the
department of Biblical study Zimmer recalls two
important examples: the Gospel Codex of St.
Gallen written in Greek with a Latin translation and
the Codex Boernerianus, now in Dresden, which
contains the Epistles of St.&nbsp;Paul in Greek together
with an interlinear Latin version. Both belong to
the ninth century.<a id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>These various examples of a knowledge of Greek
and of the necessary materials for teaching it, such
as grammars, paradigms, vocabularies and glosses,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
as well as interlinear translations clearly point to the
conclusion that Greek was taught in the Irish
monastic schools of the seventh and eighth centuries.
In our next chapter when we come to
examine the scope of Irish scholarship, the knowledge
of Greek will be so evident in the case of the
great ninth century scholars like Sedulius of Liège,
Dungal of Pavia, Clement the successor of Alcuin
at the Palace School and Scottus Eriugena that it
is unnecessary to discuss the matter further at
present. The question as to where these scholars
got their classical training can be answered best by
saying that they got it in the monastic schools of
Ireland where we have shown that the classical
tradition was unbroken from at least as early as the
sixth century, possibly a century or two earlier.<a id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>De Jubainville declares that in the ninth century
the Irish scholars were the only persons in Western
Europe who knew Greek.<a id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> Traube claims that in
the time of Charles the Bald at least the Irish were
the sole representatives of Greek scholarship:
“they could read and write Greek, they could
transcribe it, nay, they even ventured occasionally
to make Greek verses.”<a id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> Anyone who in the time
of Charles the Bald was credited with a knowledge
of Greek was, according to Traube, an Irishman,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
or had learned it from an Irishman, or his reputation
for Greek scholarship was a fraud.<a id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> It is significant
that the copy of the work of Dionysius the
Areopagite, which Pope Paul had presented to King
Pippin had to wait for an Irishman, Johannes
Scottus Eriugena, to translate it for Charles the
Bald.<a id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>That a knowledge of Greek was indispensable for
a study of the Scriptures would in itself be sufficient
to account for the study of Greek in the Irish
monastic schools. A further reason for the Irish
love of Greek has been suggested by several
writers. Michelet says: “Le génie celtique, qui
est celui de l’individualité, sympathise profondément
avec le génie grec.”<a id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> As we have pointed
out, the Greek views in philosophy and theology
appealed in an especial manner to Irish scholars of
this period. According to Healy, “the Irish
mind, like the Greek, has a natural love for
speculation, is quick, subtle, and far-seeing, has
greater power of abstraction and generalization—that
is, greater metaphysical power than the
phlegmatic Anglo-Saxon.”<a id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> We venture no
opinion as to whether this proposition will stand a
critical examination but would merely record the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
fact that other able writers when dealing with this
period have also discerned much in common between
the Hellenic and the Celtic mind. Mullinger notes
“a certain speculative, outlooking quality certainly
not very apparent in the school of York.”<a id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>
Cardinal Newman declares that as Rome was the
centre of authority in these ages so Ireland was the
native home of speculation; while contrasting the
English scholars with the Irish he says: “The
Englishman was hardworking, plodding, bold,
determined, persevering, obedient to law and
precedent, and if he cultivated his mind he was
literary rather than scientific. In Ireland, on the
other hand, the intellect seems to have taken the
line of science and we have various instances to
show how fully this was recognised. ‘Philosopher’
in these times is almost synonymous with ‘Irish
Monk’.”<a id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> It was this characteristic of the Irish
monks Renan<a id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> had in mind when he spoke of them
as “les colonisateurs scientifiques d’Europe
occidentale.”</p>

<p>A further resemblance, and one of a less promising
character, may be traced in the predilection
shown by both the Greek and the Gael for questions
which admitted a display of dialectical subtlety.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
It was this feature which arrested the attention of
Benedict of Aniane and aroused his dislike for the
Irish theologians. They were distinguished, he
tells us, for syllogistic mystification. “Apud
modernos scholasticos maxime apud Scottos iste
syllogismus delusionis.”<a id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> Mullinger tells us that
they would sometimes amuse themselves by interrogating
some stolid representative of orthodoxy, and
compel him as a logical sequence of his replies, to
admit the existence of three Gods or to disavow his
belief in the Trinity.<a id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> This typically national
characteristic of adding a humorous touch to a
profound but dry metaphysical discussion has for
us a deep human interest, though it was undoubtedly
embarrassing to learned and solemn opponents who
could neither understand, nor sympathise with, the
rather subtle and complex Irish temperament.</p>

<p>It has also been remarked that this tendency to speculation led the
Irish to admire the work of Martianus Capella whose volume was a sealed
book to the school of York; while in the three great monasteries of
Luxeuil, St.&nbsp;Gall, and Bobbio numerous MSS. in the original Irish
character (Scottice scripta) of Origen and other Greek Fathers remained
to attest the more inquiring spirit in which the studies of their
communities were pursued. Thanks to his Greek studies and his natural
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> mental
attitude the Irish Theologian became a better astronomer as well as a
better dialectician.<a id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414"
class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<h3>MUSIC:</h3>

<p>Music constituted an important element in Irish
culture both in pagan and in Christian times.
Hectateus, the great geographer quoted by
Diodorus, is the first who mentions the name Celt
and he describes the Celts of Ireland as singing
songs in praise of Apollo and playing melodiously
on the harp (c. 500&nbsp;<span class="small">B.C.</span>).<a id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> Native Irish literature
abounds in reference to music and musicians who
were always spoken of in terms of the highest
respect. Everywhere through these ancient records
we find evidence that the Irish people both high and
low were passionately fond of music. It entered
into their daily lives and formed a part of their
amusements and celebrations of every kind.<a id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>
Zeuss in his <i>Grammatica Celtica</i> (1853) was the
first to give the key to the nature of the musical
instruments used in ancient Ireland. The references
to music given by Zeuss were taken from glosses
dating from 650&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> to 900&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> and written by
the Irish monks of St.&nbsp;Gall. O’Curry,<a id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Joyce,<a id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
and Flood<a id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> have followed up the work of Zeuss, so
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
we have now a fairly clear idea of the state of
musical culture during the period under investigation.
Flood gives the names of twelve different
instruments in use and of nine professional names
of the performers.<a id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> It is not without significance
that the harp is the national symbol. There are
references to the harp in Irish literature probably
as early as the fifth century.<a id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> O’Curry was so
impressed with the many evidences he found of a
high degree of musical culture that he could not
restrain his enthusiasm. He says: “If ever
there was a people gifted with a musical soul and
sensibility in a higher degree than another I would
venture to assert that the Ancient Gaedhil of Ireland
were that people.”<a id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>The monks were no exception to their fellow-countrymen
in their love of music, consequently in
Christian times music was intimately connected with
public worship.<a id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> In the early ages of the Church
many of the Irish ecclesiastics took delight in playing
the harp and in order to indulge this innocent
and refining taste they were wont to take with them
a small portable harp when going from place to
place.<a id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> Figures of men playing the harp are
common on the stone crosses seen at Graig, Ullard,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Clonmacnoise, Durrow and Monasterboice, as also
on the shrines of ancient reliquaries.<a id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> It appears
from several authorities that the practice of playing
on the harp as an accompaniment to the voice was
common in Ireland as early as the fifth or sixth
century.<a id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>During the long period when learning flourished
Irish professors and teachers of music would seem
to have been quite as much in request as teachers
of literature and philosophy. In the middle of the
seventh century Gertrude (daughter of Pepin,
Mayor of the Palace) when abbess of Niville in
Belgium engaged Foillan and Ultan brothers of St.
Fursey to instruct her nuns in Psalmody.<a id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> It has
been asserted that Gregorian chant coloured
much of the music of Ireland from the fifth to the
eighth century, but Gregorian chant dates only
from 593&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> and, as Flood pointed out, both the
psalmody and the hymnody of the Irish were distinctly
Celtic in the first half of the seventh century
and were mainly adaptations of the old pre-Christian
melodies.<a id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>The musical fame of St.&nbsp;Gall monastery in
Switzerland is known to many, but the fact is often
ignored that its foundation in 612&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> is due to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Irish saint Cellach whose name has been latinised
Gallus or Gall. St.&nbsp;Gall was a student of the monastery
of Bangor (in Co. Down, Ireland) and the
friend and pupil of Columban whom he accompanied
to the Continent. When St.&nbsp;Gall died in 645&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>
the fame of his music school had spread far and
near.<a id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> In the year 870&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> Moengal, another
Irishman, was appointed headmaster of the Music
School of St.&nbsp;Gall and under his rule it became
“the wonder and delight of Europe.”<a id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Moengal
laboured for ten years on behalf of the school. It
should be added that Moengal was also learned in
theology and secular sciences. “Erat in divinas
et humanis eruditissimus.”<a id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> The copying of music
became such a feature of the work done at St.&nbsp;Gall
that “the scribes of this monastery supplied all
Germany with manuscript books of the Gregorian
Chant, all beautifully illuminated.”<a id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Moengal
gave music its highest place amongst the arts and
the school of St.&nbsp;Gall reached its highest perfection
under three of Moengal’s pupils, Ratpert, Notker
and Tuotilo.<a id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> In Zimmer’s opinions there were
very few men who exercised such a beneficent influence
over Germany in the ninth century as did
Moengal and his successors.<a id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>Moengal was succeeded in 890&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> by Tuathal
(latinised Tuotilo and sometimes Tutilo), his pupil
and fellow-countryman. Tuotilo (d. 915&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>)
was even more famous than his master and was not
only a skilled musician but was famed as a poet,
orator, painter, goldsmith, builder and sculptor.
We are told that he was a skilled performer on the
cruit and psaltery. Père Schubiger published many
of the <i>tropes</i> composed by Tuotilo. Flood assures
us that two of these <i>Hodie Cantandus</i> and
<i>Omnipotens Genator</i> betray the well-known characteristics
of Irish music.<a id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435"
class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Tuotilo also composed
the famous farced <i>Kyrie, Fons Bonitatis</i>, included
in the Vatican collection of Kyriale.<a id="FNanchor_436"></a><a
href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>Another famous pupil of Moengal’s was Notker
or Notker Balbulus the author of a valuable collection
of hymns known as <i>Liber Ymnorum Notkeri</i>
which was illuminated by an Irish artist. Notker
shed undying lustre on the school of St.&nbsp;Gall and
was one of the most celebrated musicians of the
Middle Ages.<a id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>St.&nbsp;Gall was not the only monastery of Irish
origin in which the study of music was pursued with
success. Indeed, the musical influence of the Irish
monks was felt over the whole west of Europe
wherever their monasteries were established, not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
only in Ireland and Scotland but also throughout
a large part of England, France, Belgium, Germany,
Italy and Austria.<a id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>Hymnologists are more or less familiar with the
hymns composed by Irish poets such as Sedulius,
Dungal and Moengal, and by saints like Sechnall,
Columba, Molaise, Cuchuimne, Columban, Ultan,
Colman, Cummian, Aengus, Fiacc, Brodan,
Sanctan and Moelisu.<a id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p>Thus did the Irish monks both by their teaching
and by their writings promote the cultivation of
music in a very practical way. Nor was the theoretical
aspect of music neglected. Donnchadh, an
Irish bishop of the ninth century, who died abbot of
Remigius, wrote a commentary on the work of
Martianus Capella, a well-known volume on the
“Liberal Arts,” a section of which treats of music.
The greatest of his contemporaries, Johannes
Scottus Eriugena, in his famous philosophical work
<i>De Divisione Naturae</i>, written in 867&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> expounds
<i>organum</i> or <i>discant</i> a hundred years before the
appearance of <i>Scholia Enchiriadis</i> and <i>Musica
Enchiriadis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> He also wrote a commentary on
<i>Martianus Capella</i> which is now in a Paris MS. of
the ninth century.<a id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Summarising the history of Irish music prior to
the close of the ninth century Flood says:<a id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> “The
Irish were acquainted with the Ogam music tablature
in pre-Christian ages; they had battle marches,
dance tunes, folk songs, chants and hymns in the
fifth century; they were the earliest to adopt the
neums or neumatic notation for the plain chant of
the Western Church; they modified and introduced
Irish melodies into the Gregorian Chant; they had
an intimate acquaintance with the diatonic scale
long before it was perfected by Guido of Arezzo.
They were the first to employ harmony and counterpoint;
they had quite an array of bards and poets;
they employed blank verse, elegiac rhymes, consonant,
assonant, inverse, burthen, dissyllabic,
trisyllabic, and quadrisyllabic rhymes, not to say
anything of the caoines, laments, elegies, metrical
romances, etc.; they had a world-famed school of
harpers, and finally they diffused musical knowledge
over Europe.”</p>


<h3>ART:</h3>

<p>A lengthy discussion of the subject of Irish art
lies outside the scope of our present study. We
shall therefore content ourselves with making a
rapid survey of some of its more characteristic
features and with noting the part played by the
monastic schools in its development and cultivation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>
<p>In the first chapter it was pointed out that
there was a native art in Ireland before the
introduction of Christianity and that the pagan
Irish exhibited considerable artistic skill in their
bronze, silver, gold, and enamel work as the
specimens still preserved in our museums go
to prove. From the pagan period we have
numerous torques, gorgets, lunulae and other
articles of personal adornment. These show
that the pagan artist possessed both skill and taste
in a high degree.<a id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> The character of the arts
introduced into Ireland with Christianity was therefore
grafted upon and modified by the native arts
while new variations in design were introduced from
the Continent by missionaries and foreign artists
that came to Ireland. Thus art as practised in
early Christian Ireland was no slavish imitation of
foreign art but rather a development of native art
whose progress was upward from the introduction
of Christianity in the fourth and fifth century until
the Norman invasion in the twelfth.<a id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>


<h3>CHARACTERISTICS OF IRISH ART:</h3>

<p>The chief characteristics of Irish art are:</p>

<p>1. A symmetrical interlacement of a band or
bands into a variety of patterns.</p>

<p>2. The graceful divergence of lines into trumpet
forms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The coiling of one or two very fine lines into
mysterious spirals a lengthened examination of
which has a weirdly fascinating effect on the eye.</p>

<p>4. A total disregard for the comforts of animal
life, the bodies and members being twisted and distorted
to suit the convenience of the artist.</p>

<p>5. The human figure is frequently introduced,
but it is subjected to the rigidity of the curved lines
noticeable in the interlacings and spirals. Herein
Irish art, which is primarily <i>ornamental</i>, differs
from classic art, which is <i>representative</i>. The
Irish artist aimed at symmetry and hence the right
side of the face is generally a reproduction of the
left.</p>

<p>6. In nearly all the art of the period under consideration
the ground is divided into panels, or
geometrical compartments—an arrangement whereby
the artist whether working on vellum, metal,
leather or stone was free to introduce any of the
foregoing characteristics without marring the harmony
and uniformity of the design.<a id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>Irish art attained its highest excellence in four
branches, namely, writing and illumination of
manuscripts, metal work and stone carving. In a
previous chapter were discussed the characteristics
of the Irish style of handwriting and the part played
by the monastic schools in its development so we
pass on to consider the other three departments
of art work.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<h3>ILLUMINATION:</h3>

<p>Shortly after the Irish monks became skilled
penmen they began to illuminate their books with
brilliant colours which they learned to combine into
elaborate and harmonious designs. This art reached
its most perfect stage of development at the close
of the eighth or beginning of the ninth century.
The monks were wont to lavish all the wealth of
their artistic skill on books containing the whole or
portions of the Holy Scriptures. As instances of
this style of illuminated MSS. the <i>Psalter of ColmCille</i>,
the <i>Book of Dimma</i>, the <i>Book of Armagh</i>,
and, above all, the <i>Book of Kells</i> should be mentioned.
While each of these books has many
merits the book which has compelled the admiration
yet defied the imitation of every European artist is
the <i>Book of Kells</i>. Describing this venerable
volume which was written and illuminated about the
middle of the ninth century, Sir Edward O’Sullivan
writes as follows:<a id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> “Its weird and commanding
beauty; its subdued and goldless colouring; the
baffling intricacy of its fearless designs; the clean
unwavering sweep of rounded spiral; the creeping
undulations of serpentine forms that writhe in
artistic profusion throughout the mazes of its
decorations; the strong and legible minuscule of the
text; the quaintness of its striking portraiture; the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
unwearied reverence and patient labour which
brought it into being, all of which combined to make
the <i>Book of Kells</i>, have raised this ancient volume
to a position of abiding pre-eminence amongst the
illuminated MSS. of the world.”</p>

<p>Other artists are equally emphatic in their praises
of the work of Irish artists during the period under
consideration.</p>

<p>Westwood writes: “Ireland may justly be proud
of the <i>Book of Kells</i>. &hellip; At a period when
the fine arts may be said to be almost extinct in
Italy and other parts of the Continent, nearly from
the fifth to the end of the eighth century, the art of
ornamenting MSS. had a perfection almost
miraculous in Ireland. &hellip; The invention and
skill displayed, the neatness, precision, and delicacy
far surpass all that is found in MSS. executed by
Continental artists.”<a id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>Referring to the interlaced style of ornament
introduced in the seventh and eighth century
Coffey<a id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> informs us that this new style with all its
intricacy was brought to a marvellous perfection
in the Irish monastic schools. The same writer
further assures us that the Irish MSS. (with which
he would class the Hiberno-Saxon MSS. in the
production of which the Irish scribes took such
important a part) admittedly stand in quite the first
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
place among early MSS. for the excellence of their
penmanship and illustrations.</p>

<p>As showing that the Irish style of art had more
than a local influence the testimony of another art
critic, Mr. Digby Wyatt, is worth quoting. He
says: “In close connection with the Irish church
existed a school of art remarkable for its sense of the
graceful and grotesque, and for its superiority in
point of ornamental design to any other style of the
same period. That its influence extended much
farther than is generally supposed would appear
certain, and not only did Scotland, Wales, Cornwall,
the North of England and Scandinavia adopt its
peculiar system of ornament, but some of the
MSS. in the libraries of Europe are now discovered
to have emanated from this school.”<a id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>The colours of the <i>Book of Kells</i> are remarkably
well preserved after a lapse of one thousand years.
Professor Hartley<a id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> a few years ago submitted the
pigments to a careful examination and discovered
the materials of which the colours are most probably
compounded. He reported as follows: “The
black is lampblack, or possibly fishbone black;
the bright red is realgar (arsenic disulphide As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>)
the yellow, orpiment (arsenic tersulphide As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>);
the emerald green, malachite; the deep blue
possibly lapis lazuli, but owing to its transparency
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
when overlying green more likely not so. The
reddish purple is either finely ground glass obtained
from a solution of gold, or a preparation which was
obtained by the action of a solution of tin and was
very expensive. The other colours are neutral
green like burnt sienna, a pale blue, and lilac.”<a id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<h3>ART METAL WORK:</h3>

<p>We have referred to the fact that the pagan Irish
were skilled workmen in metal. This class of work
received a new impetus with the introduction of
Christianity. The pre-Christian craftsmen exercised
their skill in ornamenting shields, swords,
sword-hilts, chariots, brooches, bridles, etc. as we
learn from the specimens that are preserved in our
museums.<a id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> In addition to articles of this class
the Christian artists, the majority of whom were
ecclesiastics,<a id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> made crosses, croziers, chalices,
shrines to hold books or relics as well as book satchels
in which both metal and leather were used.<a id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>
Specimens of these may be seen in the National
Museum, Dublin.<a id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> For real artistic skill the most
admired specimens are the Ardagh Chalice, the
Tara Brooch, and the Cross of Cong.<a id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
designs and styles of ornament used by the metal
workers were similar to those of the artists who
illuminated the MSS. Artistic skill in metal work
was brought to its highest degree of excellence in
the tenth and eleventh centuries and continued to
flourish until about the end of the twelfth century,
but gradually declined after that date owing to the
general disorganization of society consequent on the
Norman invasion.<a id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>


<h3>STONE CARVING:</h3>

<p>The skill of the Irish artists in stone carving is
seen at its best in the great stone crosses of which
about 55 remain in different parts of Ireland. One
peculiarity of the Irish (or Celtic) Cross is the
circular ring round the intersections, thus binding
the arms together. This peculiar form was
developed in Ireland and, once developed, remained
fixed from the eighth to the twelfth century. Of
the 55 great crosses 35 are richly ornamented and
eight have inscriptions bearing names of persons
who have been identified as living at various dates
from 904 to 1150&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span><a id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>The crosses have a style of ornamentation similar
to that of the manuscripts and of the metal work.
In addition to the ornamentation most of the crosses
have groups of figures representing various events
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
in Sacred History, such as, The Fall of Man, Noah
in the Ark, The Sacrifice of Isaac, The Fight of
David and Goliath, The Arrest of Our Lord, The
Crucifixion, The Crucifixion of St.&nbsp;Peter (head
downward), Eve Presenting the Apple to Adam,
The Journey to Egypt. These sculptures are
<i>iconographic</i>, <i>i.e.</i> they were intended to bring to
the minds of the unlettered people the facts of
Sacred History by vivid illustration. No doubt
the preachers in their discourses directed the attention
of their hearers to these representations; and
perhaps they often lectured while standing at the
foot of the cross with the people ranged in front,
the preacher pointing to the sculptured groups as
occasion demanded. It is probable that the figures
were painted in brilliant colours like those used in
illuminating the MSS. so that the people might see
them more distinctly.<a id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>


<h3>MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE:</h3>

<p>We cannot close our discussion of the curriculum
of Irish monastic schools without a brief reference
to its limitations which are especially noteworthy
in the case of mathematics and other secular
sciences. While not venturing into details some
writers manage to convey the impression that the
scientific knowledge of the Irish monks was as profound
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
as their knowledge of the classics. We have
not found any evidence to support this view. The
most that can be said in favour of the teachers of
this early period is that they willingly imparted all
the mathematical and scientific knowledge of their
time. But the actual amount of such knowledge
possessed by Western Europe prior to the tenth
century was relatively small as compared with even
the later Middle Ages not to speak of modern
times.</p>


<h3>ARITHMETIC:</h3>

<p>Prior to the tenth century arithmetic was essentially
the art of computation. It was largely
devoted to computing Easter, so the terms “Computus”
and “Arithmetic” became synonymous.<a id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>
Apart from this practical side it is possible that a
theoretical treatment of numbers was not absolutely
wanting. The method of reckoning was necessarily
crude and little progress was possible while the
cumbersome Roman system of notation made computation
with large numbers well nigh impossible.
It remains for further investigation to show whether
the arithmetical knowledge of the Irish monks
extended beyond the limits of Bede’s <i>De Tempora
Ratione</i>,<a id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> or equalled that of the <i>Liber de</i>
<i>Computo</i><a id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> of Rabanus Maurus. Our acquaintance
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
with source material in this field is too limited to
warrant any sweeping statement, but it is significant
of the nature of arithmetical knowledge of this
period and of the lack of creative ability to find a
scholar of such ability as Marianus Scottus in the
following century basing his work on Computus<a id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>
on that of Rabanus. Indeed it was not until the
introduction of the Arabic system of notation and
Hindoo methods through Arabic influence that
there was much possibility of progress in Arithmetic.
The introduction of the Arabic system is
attributed by some to Gerbert<a id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> (d. 1003&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>) but
it was not until the end of the twelfth century that
the Hindoo-Arabic system became generally established
among mathematicians. A century later
Arithmetic began to be applied to commerce.<a id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

<p><i>Algebra</i> was apparently unknown to the Irish
monks during the period under investigation and
was probably not introduced into Europe until the
twelfth century.<a id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>


<h3>GEOMETRY:</h3>

<p>Up to the tenth century, the age of Gerbert, a
knowledge of Geometry in our sense of the term
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
hardly existed in Western Europe. In fact the
term seems to have been used in its etymological
meaning and not in the sense the Greeks understood
it. We have found no evidence to warrant the
assumption that Euclidean Geometry was taught in
those early Irish monastic schools. But on the
other hand an examination of the characteristic
Irish style of ornament suggests that the Irish artist
had at least a good working knowledge of practical
Geometry. Possibly the amount of knowledge of
theoretical Geometry did not extend beyond the
narrow<a id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> limits of the works of Capella,<a id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Cassiodorus,<a id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>
and Isadore of Seville<a id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>—writers well
known to Irish scholars as we have seen.</p>


<h3>GEOGRAPHY:</h3>

<p>If the mathematical science of Geometry was still
undeveloped in the West geography, topography
and cosmography made up the deficiency. It was
but natural that the Irish monks, the greatest voyagers
of their time, should be interested in the study
of foreign lands. We have an instance of this in
the case of Adamnan who wrote his <i>De Locis
Sanctis</i> from the dictation of Arculfus, a Frankish
bishop who had visited Palestine.<a id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> Bede based
his work bearing a similar name on Adamnan’s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
volume. This work of Adamnan with that of Bede
continued to be the only source of information of
the geography, Christian antiquities, and customs
of Palestine until the Crusades gave Western
Europe a more acute and active interest in that
distant, inhospitable region.<a id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> We have referred
to a curious geographical poem<a id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> which was
evidently used as a text in the monastic schools of
Ireland. It contained probably all the geography
that was taught prior to the tenth century. The
tenth century map of the world<a id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> drawn in England
for an Anglo-Saxon is supposed to have been the
work of an Irish artist and further illustrates the
state of geographical knowledge of the times. The
more ambitious treatise of Dungal, <i>De Mensura
Orbis Terrarum</i>, which will be described in the next
chapter, marks a new departure in geographical
texts—hitherto mere compendiums—inasmuch as
it introduces new matter, is more critical, “up-to-date”
and altogether a commendable attempt for
a ninth century scholar.</p>

<p><i>Astronomy</i> had a double interest for the Irish
monks. Being great travellers in an age when
they had no compass to direct their way the
“study of the stars” was a matter of practical
interest and possibly they were more observant of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the courses of the heavenly bodies than the majority
of us are to-day. Again, the ability to compute
the date of Easter was a matter of great importance
in ecclesiastical circles in those days. The controversies
which centred around the Easter question
caused many Irish monks to give special attention
to practical methods of computing the date of
Easter. They were also led to examine the history
of the different cycles in use and finally they were
led to inquire into the theoretical aspect of the
science of Astronomy. In the present chapter we
referred to the famous Paschal Epistle of Cummian
Fada which showed that he was at one and the
same time an accomplished classical scholar and an
astronomer of no mean ability versed in all
astronomical literature of his time. Other great
astronomers were Virgilius, Dicuil and Dungal, of
whom we shall have something to say in our next
chapter when dealing with the scope of Irish
monastic scholarship. Of all the secular sciences
Astronomy was perhaps the most popular with Irish
monastic scholars the superiority of whose scholarship
in this regard is acknowledged by all writers of
the early Middle Ages.<a id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>We see, then, that though the actual amount of
mathematical and scientific knowledge possessed
by the Irish monks was small they freely taught all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
that was known at the time in Western Europe and,
limited as was their educational equipment, we may
safely conclude that it represented the maximum
attainments in western scientific knowledge prior to
the tenth century.</p>

<p>While we have no means of determining the precise
way in which the curriculum was organised, we
may safely conclude that it embraced the following
groups of studies:</p>

<p>1. <i>Vernacular Studies</i>: The Irish language, its
grammar, metrics, literature both secular and
religious, prose and poetry, history, antiquities,
etc.<a id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p>2. <i>Christian Studies</i>: Theology, especially the
study of the Scriptures with the commentaries of
the Fathers thereon, and in the ninth century at
least the study of Dialectics and Philosophy was
pursued with success.</p>

<p>3. <i>Classical Studies</i>: Acquaintance with several
Latin and Greek authors of the classical period.
Superior knowledge of Latin and a good working
knowledge of Greek.</p>

<p>4. <i>Aesthetic Studies</i>: Cultivation of Art and
Music.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>
<p>5. <i>Scientific Studies</i>: All the scientific knowledge
of the time, special emphasis on Computation
and Astronomy.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the course of studies of the
early Irish monastic school was much more varied
in scope and fuller in content than the Trivium and
Quadrivium as taught in contemporary Europe.</p>

<p class="subtitle2">SCOPE AND INFLUENCE OF IRISH SCHOLARSHIP</p>

<p>In the preceding chapter we discussed at length the
nature of the curriculum of the Irish monastic
schools. Our conclusions were based on the evidence
supplied by an examination of the writings
and other material remains which attest their Irish
authorship. Here we shall attempt to determine
the extent as well as the limitations of Irish scholarship,
and briefly indicate the influence which that
scholarship may reasonably claim to have exerted
on the history of mediæval education. As illustrations
of types of Irish scholars who attained
eminence in a special field and yet displayed considerable
versatility we have selected five: Virgilius,
Dicuil, Dungal, Sedulius and Eriugena.
These may fairly be considered as representing
Irish scholarship of the period at its best.<a id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> All
except Virgilius belong to the ninth century.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>
<p>Virgilius, bishop of Salzburg (766–7–784–5
<span class="small">A.D.</span>) whose name is a latinised form of the Irish
name Fearghal, was one of the few men who in the
eighth century cultivated the profane sciences.<a id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>
Indeed the age in which he lived was equally
unfavourable to the pursuit of science or to the
encouragement of speculative thought, as Virgilius
found from experience. On one occasion, Boniface,
the Papal Legate, denounced him for promulgating
false doctrines inasmuch as he maintained
that the sun and moon passed under the earth, and
that there must be inhabitants on the other side.<a id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>
Boniface had a previous dispute with Virgilius over
a theological question in which the Pope decided in
favour of Virgilius. Either from ignorance of
Astronomy or, as some think, through pique, Boniface
appears to have misrepresented the real views
of Virgilius so as to convey the impression that he
taught that there was another world and another
sun and moon and consequently other men who were
not redeemed by Our Lord.<a id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> The versions of
Virgilius’ teaching which we have given would
appear to represent his real views on the subject.
At any rate he seems to have explained his doctrine
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
to the satisfaction of the Pope; for we find no
further mention of the controversy and he retained
his see until his death in 784–5&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span><a id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> His teachings
show that he must have held that the world
was spherical, though he was wrong in his theory
that the sun and stars revolved round the earth.
Even this semi-correct theory was a decided
advance on contemporary views on astronomical
matters and shows that Virgilius was an original
thinker on scientific subjects, or else it argues for
his acquaintance with Greek literature in which he
may have become familiar with the doctrine of
Eudoxus and Eratosthenes, as to the sphericity of
the earth.<a id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> As Virgilius was bishop of Aghaboe in
Ireland before he went to the Continent, it is most
improbable that he received his education any place
other than in an Irish monastic school. Unlike
many of the Irish scholars who went abroad the
name of Virgilius is recorded in the Irish annals, a
circumstance which would lead us to suppose that
he was already famous for his scholarship before he
went abroad. An additional reason for believing
that he had acquired a reputation as a scientist is
the fact that he is called in the annals Virgil or
Fergal the “Geometer.”<a id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

<p><i>Dicuil</i> (d. 825&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>) is another instance of an
Irish scholar who was interested in secular studies.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
His chief claim to fame rests on a Latin tract
entitled <i>De Mensura Orbis Terrarum</i>.<a id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> As the
name would suggest, this was a work of geography
in the sense that the term is now used. The internal
evidence leaves no doubt as to the Irish birth and
education of the author. He speaks of <i>nostri
Scoti, nostra insula Hibernia</i>, alludes to the Irish
poet Sedulius whom he styles <i>noster Sedulius</i> and
he shows an accurate knowledge of the islands near
Britain and Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> He tells that a certain
Suibneus (in Irish Suibhne anglicised Sweeney) was
his master to whom under God he owed whatever
knowledge he possessed. This Suibhne has been
identified with Suibhne, abbot of Clonmacnoise,
who died 810&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span><a id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> This would suggest that
Dicuil was a pupil of the famous school of Clonmacnoise.</p>

<p>He derived his material from three sources:</p>

<p>1. He utilised the report of the Theodosian survey.
He tells us that he made it the basis of his
work because though vitiated by false MSS. it was
less faulty than Pliny especially in its measurements.</p>

<p>2. He utilised the works of previous geographers.</p>

<p>3. He made several interesting additions to
existing knowledge which he derived from trustworthy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
accounts of Irish monks who were the greatest travellers of the
time.</p>

<p>The list of authors from whom he borrowed is
very large, including Pliny, Solinus, Isidore, Virgil,
Crosius, Servius, Hectateus, Homer, Herodotus
and other Greek writers.<a id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p>Dicuil is the first writer to refer to Iceland, which
he describes under the name Thule from an account
given to him by some Irish monks who visited that
island about thirty years previously (c. 795&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>)
and remained there from February to August.</p>

<p>He was also the first to give authentic information
about the Faroe Islands, which were visited by Irish
hermits a hundred years before, but were forsaken
on account of the piratical incursions of the Northmen.</p>

<p>The truth of these interesting accounts is proved
in two ways: 1, the tolerably exact statements as
to the length and shortness of the days could only
be determined by a resident of the place; 2, from
northern and independent sources we learn that the
first Norwegian settlers who were of course pagans
found Christians whom they called <i>Papar</i>. These
Papar left Irish books, croziers, bells and other
things behind them when they went away.<a id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>When describing the Nile he introduces the
narrative of a brother Fidelis who with a party of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
priests and monks made a journey from Ireland to
the Holy Land.<a id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

<p>To be fair to Dicuil, we must judge his work not
by modern scientific standards but by the standards
of the ninth century. We must at least acknowledge
that he made a genuine effort to obtain the
most accurate available information and that he was
more than usually conscientious, for when Pliny’s
figures seemed to him to be inaccurate, he left a
blank space.<a id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the <i>Liber de Mensura Orbis
Terrarum</i>, Dicuil is the author of a short poem of
twenty hexameters which he prefixed to a copy of
a short treatise by Priscian,<a id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> and of an astronomical
work in prose and verse which is still unpublished.<a id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
This latter is dedicated to Louis the Pious and
mentions Dicuil by name. We may therefore infer
that this geographer, astronomer and poet was one
of the versatile Irish scholars whose work must
have contributed in no small degree to the Carolingian
revival of learning. This distinguished
scholar is believed to be identical with the Dicuil
who was abbot of Pahlacht in the ninth century.<a id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p><i>Dungal</i> is another of those ninth century scholars
of whose life the details are all too meagre. From
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
a few fragmentary references and his existing works
we are led to the conclusion that he was a very
capable man distinguished not only as a theologian
and poet but also as an astronomer and schoolmaster.<a id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>In the year 811&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> he wrote a letter to Charlemagne
to explain the double eclipse of the sun that
was supposed to have occurred the previous year.
This letter is written in excellent Latin showing
familiarity with Virgil and Cicero.<a id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>Moreover it shows an intimate acquaintance with
the whole field of astronomical literature of the time,
but it is chiefly remarkable for the expression of
astronomical views that were considered advanced
because they seemed to call in question the truth
of the Ptolemaic system.<a id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<p>In the year 825&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> the Emperor Lothair
desiring to carry out the enlightened educational
policy of his ancestor Charlemagne issued an Edict<a id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
complaining that through the extreme carelessness
and indolence of certain superiors true teaching was
shaken to its very foundations, and urging that
persons engaged in teaching in all those places
hereinafter mentioned should throw all their zeal
and energy into securing the progress of their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
disciples and that they should apply themselves to
science as the necessity of the times demanded.
He laid out for this exercise certain places chosen
in such a manner that neither time nor distance
nor poverty might any more serve as an
excuse to the people. He desired therefore
at Pavia and <i>under the superintendence of
Dungal all students should assemble</i> from Milan,
Brescia, Lodi, Bergamo, Novara, Vercelli, Tortona,
Acqui, Genoa, Asti, and Como.<a id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> Thus we see
what a responsible position Dungal occupied as head
of the school of Pavia—the precursor of the famous
university.</p>

<p>Dungal himself informs us that he was an Irishman
in a poem in praise of Charlemagne which
commences with these words: “These verses the
Irish Exile (<i>exul Hibernicus</i>) sends to King
Charles.” He composed several other poems,<a id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>
but that written to Charlemagne is his longest and
best effort. The shorter poems display considerable
taste but not much imagination.<a id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p>In 828&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> Dungal appeared in a controversy
against Claudius, bishop of Turin, who had written
against the veneration of images. It will be recalled
that this Claudius was the learned and gifted
Spaniard who described the Council of Italian
bishops as a “council of asses” (<i>congregatio
asinorum</i>). Against this formidable opponent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Dungal was called upon to undertake the defence
of the veneration of images. As Zimmer remarks,
“these two learned adversaries, Claudius the
Spaniard and Dungal the Irishman, who met on
the soil of Lombardy, were the representatives of
two countries—the only ones—which offered an
asylum to Graeco-Roman culture at the beginning
of the seventh century when it had declined in the
West. Ireland was especially conspicuous in introducing
it anew in the form of Christianity, principally
into France, these efforts being made when
civilization was at its lowest ebb and the country
in its most degraded condition.”<a id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>We are not concerned here with the theological
question at issue, but it may be remarked that
Dungal’s reply<a id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> shows that he was a man of wide
culture, “accomplished too in sacred literature, and
at the same time trained in grammatical laws and in
the classical excellence of style as will readily appear
to anyone who reads his writings.”<a id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> Alzog informs
us that the sophistical reasoning of Claudius
was refuted by Jonas, bishop of Orleans, but much
more ably by Dungal. He is styled an excellent
theologian (<i>theologus excellans</i>) by a contemporary
and Healy declares that Dungal’s is the first and
best work that was written on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
many quotations from Greek and Latin poets which
occur in his reply to Claudius as well as in his epistle
to Charlemagne prove that Dungal had a strong
love for poetry and that he was well read in classic
literature.<a id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> Thus we see that Dungal’s education
was built on a broad foundation, for he was distinguished
as an astronomer and a theologian as
well as a poet and a schoolmaster.</p>

<p>The last act of Dungal of which we have any
record is his gift of books to the library of Bobbio.<a id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>
Dungal is greatly praised by Muratori, Mabillon,
Bellarmine and others for his learning and he was
valued both in Italy and France for his varied
attainments. Muratori, who published a catalogue<a id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>
of the library of Bobbio, says that “Dungal carried
into Italy the Scotic love of learning.” Among
the books which Dungal presented to Bobbio is one
which was catalogued as Psalterium but named by
Muratori as the <i>Antiphonary of Bangor</i>,<a id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> a book of
hymns compiled expressly for the use of the
monastic community of Bangor in Co. Down (Ireland).
It is written in Latin, but it contains the
strongest internal evidence of its Irish origin. On
the strength of the evidence furnished by the fact
that Dungal possessed this book many believe that
Dungal himself was a pupil of Bangor. If so, we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
have in Dungal an excellent example of the type of
education available in this famous monastic school
in the ninth century.</p>

<h3>SEDULIUS:</h3>

<p>Under the Emperor Lothair 840–855 there was
at Liège a colony of Irish teachers and writers of
whom the best known is Sedulius, sometimes called
Sedulius the Younger to distinguish him from the
author of the <i>Carmen Paschale</i>. We have already
referred to the fact that he was a distinguished
poet<a id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> and a learned grammarian.<a id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> He is no less
famous as a scribe<a id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> and as a writer on other subjects.</p>

<p>He wrote an important treatise on the theory of
government entitled <i>De Rectoribus Christianis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>
This work was written at Liège probably about the
year 855&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> It is in reality the first systematic
contribution of the Middle Ages to the theory of
political government and should rank in importance
with St.&nbsp;Thomas’s <i>De Regimine Principis</i>, with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Colonna’s <i>De Regimine Principum</i> and with
Dante’s <i>De Monarchia</i>.<a id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> As its latest editor Dr.
Hellman has remarked, if this work is not drawn
from exclusively Irish sources, it is drawn at least
from sources which were held in high esteem by
Irish writers of the Carolingian Age. This Celtic
conception of the duties of a Christian ruler is of
very special interest to the student of mediæval
political theories. Its sources are Christian and
classical, its immediate object was the direction of
a Frankish ruler (probably Lothair II.), the mind
that conceived it was Celtic and here we have at
the beginning of mediæval speculation a combination
of forces and interests which went to make up the
mediæval policy.<a id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p>

<p>Sedulius also wrote a commentary of Porphry’s
<i>Isagoge</i> (or Introduction to the Logic of Aristotle)
for which the basis may have been the Greek text
though the work was known to other Christian
logicians only in the Latin translation.<a id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<h3>JOHANNES SCOTUS ERIUGENA (d. 877&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>):</h3>

<p>This was by far the greatest Irish scholar of the
ninth century. Indeed in many ways he was the
most remarkable man of his age. Of his early life
we have no details. He was born between the years
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
800–815&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span> The general opinion of scholars is
that he was born in Ireland as his name would indicate.<a id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
His learning itself is sufficient proof that
he was educated in Ireland where alone he could
get the benefit of such an education as the continental
schools could no longer have furnished.<a id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

<p>About the middle of the ninth century he
appeared at the court of King Charles the Bald
by whom he was placed at the head of the Palace
School. Though in some respects a worthless
sovereign, Charles had at least one redeeming
quality inasmuch as he emulated the example of
his grandfather (Charlemagne) as a patron of
letters. During his reign Irish scholars flocked in
great numbers to the Continent. The monarch was
fond of discussing knotty questions, and had a keen
taste for the subtle disputations to which Irish
dialectitians were devoted. Encouraged by his
patronage the Irish monks emigrated in so great
numbers to France that hostelries were built for
their exclusive use.<a id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> The most eminent of these
exiles<a id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> was Eriugena. No sooner had he reached
France (c. 845&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>) than he was recognised as a
remarkable linguist. Certain reputed works of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Dionysius the Areopagite had been sent by Pope
Paul I. to Pepin-le-Bref, and a splendid MS. of the
mystical writings of the same author was subsequently
presented to Louis the Pious by the
Byzantine Emperor Michael. The works were of
course in the Greek language and the greatest
scholars of France were unable to translate them
or to interpret their meaning.<a id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> The task was
finally entrusted to Eriugena and he produced a
satisfactory version. The learned Anastasius, the
papal librarian, on reading the version of Eriugena,
wrote to King Charles expressing his surprise that
“a barbarian who hailed from the extreme confines
of the world and who might have been deemed
to be as ignorant of Greek as he was remote from
civilization could have proved capable of comprehending
the mysteries of the Greek tongue.”<a id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<p>Great as was his fame as a linguist his reputation
as a philosopher is still greater. His philosophical
speculations gave rise to discussions and controversies
which even to the present day occupy the
attention of the greatest thinkers. In his own day
his views were nothing short of sensational. In
addition to his translation of the Pseudo-Dionysius
already referred to, Eriugena wrote a comprehensive
philosophical work <i>De Divisione Naturae</i><a id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
a treatise <i>De Egressu et Regressu Animae ad
Deum</i> of which only a fragment has come down to
us.<a id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> He also contributed a treatise <i>De Predestinatione</i>
to a theological controversy that was
waged at that time. This work seems to have
given offence to both parties. His <i>expositiones</i> or
commentaries on the Pseudo-Dionysius are helpful
in determining his philosophical views. He also
wrote a commentary on the work of Martianus
Capella, <i>De Nuptiis</i>.</p>

<p>It is as a philosopher, however, that Eriugena
stands without an equal during his own time. It
has been remarked that Eriugena appears to have
been born subject to a strange fatality whereby
men’s opinions are always changing in regard to
his philosophical views and the position to be
assigned to him among philosophers. In the
criticisms by Maurice Milman, Staudenmaier,
St.&nbsp;Rene, Tailander, Christlieb, Hauréau, and Huber
the view of each writer differs in some important
respect from the views of the rest.<a id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> This is no
less true of the criticism of living philosophers as
the following quotations from two standard works
on the <i>History of Philosophy</i> go to show. De
Wülf writes: “In opposition to the majority of
historians who describe Eriugena as the first of
scholastics, we have no hesitation in calling him
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the first of anti-scholastics—and the most formidable
at the present epoch. For his teaching propounds
principles which are opposed to those of
scholasticism and which form the starting-point of
opposition movements.”<a id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> Turner, on the other
hand, says that Eriugena illustrates the many
sidedness of the scholastic movement and proceeds
as follows: “To classify as anti-scholastic whatever
does not agree with the synthetic systems
of the great masters of scholasticism is to break the
line of continuous historical development which led
through failure and partial success of Eriugena,
Abelard, and other philosophers to the philosophy
of the thirteenth century. Scholasticism in its final
form is the outcome of the forces of Christian
civilization which in different conditions and in less
favourable circumstances produced the imperfect
scholasticism of the period of beginning and the
period of growth.”<a id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p>Whatever may be the difference of opinion as to
his place in a particular school or system of
philosophy there can be but one as to his abilities as
a scholar and an original thinker. According to De
Wülf, “he must be regarded as one of the most
striking personalities in the world of culture and
learning in the early Middle Ages. He was far in
advance of his time. While his contemporaries
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
were only lisping in philosophy and his successors
for centuries did little more than discuss a small
number of disconnected philosophical questions,
Eriugena in the ninth century worked out a complete
philosophical synthesis. &hellip; He was at
once a scholar and a man of genius. What was
altogether unique in the ninth century, he knew
Greek, of which Alcuin scarcely knew the
alphabet.”<a id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> Turner while wishing to give a fair
estimate of his place in history, warns us “not to
let his brilliant qualities blind us to the enormity of
his errors,”<a id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> but the same writer acknowledges that
“he was without doubt the most learned man in his
century, he was the first of the representatives of
the new learning to attempt a system of constructive
thought and he brought to his task a truly Celtic
wealth of imagination and a spiritual force which
lifted him above the plane of his contemporaries—mere
epitomisers and commentators. His
philosophy has all the charm which pantheism
always possesses for a certain class of minds. It
is subtle, vague, and poetic. When we come to
examine its contents and method we find it dominated
with the spirit of Neo-Platonism. Through
the works of Pseudo-Dionysius and of Maximus,
Eriugena made acquaintance with the teaching of
Plotinus and Proculus; and when he came to construct
his own system of thought he reproduced
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
the essential traits of Neo-Platonic philosophy—pantheism,
the doctrine of intuition, and universal
redemption.”</p>

<p>The sentence enunciated by Eriugena in his work
on Predestination<a id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> as well as elsewhere that the
true religion is also the true philosophy and <i>vice
versa</i> is the theme of the entire scholastic
philosophy. The consequences that follow from
this maxim as enunciated that every doubt in regard
to religious matters can be refuted by philosophy
appeared so preposterous that a meeting of French
clergy declared it to be insanity or blasphemy.<a id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
Religion is to Eriugena in its relations to
philosophy what authority is to reason. In respect
to rank reason precedes so also in respect to time,
since what is taught by authority of the Fathers
was discovered by them with the help of reason.
The weak must naturally subject themselves to
authority, but those who are less weak should be
content with this all the less because the figurative
nature of many expressions and further the undeniable
accommodation exercised by the Fathers
toward the understanding of the uneducated demand
the use of reason as a corrective.<a id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> By reason is
to be understood, however, not mere subjective
opinion but the common thought which reveals itself
in conversation when out of two reasons both are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
made one, each of the speakers becoming as it were
the other.<a id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> While he maintains the priority of
reason he is far from being a rationalist. Indeed
he is more inclined to take side with the mystics—to
belittle all reason unless it is illumined from on
high. “Instead of rationalising theology, he
would theosophise philosophy.”<a id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p>Thus we see how Eriugena’s philosophical
speculations naturally became the basis for innumerable
controversies which are still far from being
definitely decided. Such controversies, however,
have served a useful purpose in the history of
philosophy. Eriugena assigns to philosophy the
fourfold task: to divide, to define, to demonstrate,
to analyse. This may be described as Eriugena’s
definition of the applicability of dialectic to
philosophy and theology—a notion which, like the
union of faith and science, is destined to develop in
the subsequent growth of philosophy.<a id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>Eriugena’s knowledge of Greek, and fondness for
Greek dogma and Alexandrine philosophy, led to
the report that he made several journeys to Greece.
But this conjecture has no foundation in fact.<a id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>
Indeed the evidence we have collected with
reference to the course of studies pursued in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
Irish monastic schools would point to Ireland as the
most likely place where he laid the foundations of
his classical scholarship.</p>

<h3>INFLUENCE OF IRISH SCHOLARSHIP:</h3>

<p>The scope of Irish scholarship may in some
measure be judged from the existing works of the
great and better-known scholars mentioned in this
and other chapters, but the precise influence of that
scholarship is more difficult to estimate. It is only
in very recent years that we have begun to realise
how much native Irish literature and history owes
to the Irish monastic schools. In the wider field of
European scholarship there is still much room for
investigation before we can confidently assign to
Irish monastic scholarship its proper place. The
superiority of Irish classical learning has been
demonstrated and is now acknowledged by
practically all scholars who have made an intensive
study of the early Middle Ages.<a id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> But as a discerning
historian has remarked, “what is of greatest
significance is the fact that there reigned not only
among the professed scholars but among the plain
missionaries (whose name was legion) a classical
spirit, a love of literature for its own sake and a keen
delight in poetry. They brought imagination, they
brought spiritual force to a world well nigh sunk in
materialism. &hellip; Their lighter productions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
show but one side of their Scottish nature. Their
earnest single pursuit of learning in the widest sense
attainable, their solid hard work as scholars is no
less characteristic. Ireland was once the university
not only of Northern England, but of the
Frankish realm and if that progress was arrested
after the fatal inroads of the Norsemen after 795
<span class="small">A.D.</span> the seed which the Scots had sown in other
lands grew to a nobler maturity than ever it reached
on its own soil. &hellip; Wherever they went
they founded schools.”<a id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p>Many other tributes to Irish monastic scholarship
might be quoted. We have selected but two of
these partly because of the weight of authority
rightly associated with the author’s name in each
case and partly because they summarise the detailed
evidence we have presented during the course
of our study.</p>

<p>Turner says: “The Irish teachers left a lasting
impression on their own and succeeding generations.
Not only were they the chief teachers of
grammar, poetry, astronomy, music, and geography
when these branches had no other, or
scarcely any other, representative on the continent
of Europe, but they also profoundly influenced the
course of mediæval thought in matters of philosophy
and theology. Their elucidation of the
Gospel of St.&nbsp;John and their commentaries on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Epistles of St.&nbsp;Paul formed a new school of
exegesis. &hellip; They introduced the Neo-Platonic
point of view in metaphysical speculation
and carried the art of dialectic to a higher point
than it ever before attained. It is no exaggeration
to say that they were the founders of scholasticism
and that Ireland is the Ionia of mediæval
philosophy.”<a id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>

<p>Zimmer too shows that the Irish missionaries
were not merely the representatives of Christianity:
“they were instructors in every branch of science
and learning of the time, possessors and bearers of
a higher culture than was at that time to be found
anywhere on the Continent, and can surely claim to
have been the pioneers,—to have laid the corner
stone of western culture on the Continent.”<a id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>We have reached the end of our study. We
have traced the rise, growth, and influence of the
Irish monastic schools during the sixth, seventh,
eighth, and ninth centuries. Their work and influence
lasted for several centuries after the ninth,
but during the period which we have investigated
their influence was a dominant one in the history of
European education. In the later centuries other
factors contributed to the advancement of learning
in Western Europe and while the Irish contribution
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
was by no means negligible it was less distinctive,
less significant, than during the period ending with
the ninth century. If, then, we would form a
correct idea of the position that Irish monastic
schools occupy in the history of western culture, we
have but to contrast the actual state of contemporary
learning in the rest of Western Europe with
that available in these schools; or to recall their
large number and wide distribution, noting the
liberal nature of the course of studies pursued
therein and the generosity with which that
learning was extended to all irrespective of race or
social position. In either case we are driven to the
conclusion that these schools were indeed the
greatest educational factor of early mediæval
times, that they were, in reality, the universities
of the West, the lights that illumined the (so-called)
Dark Ages.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>

that given by Eoin MacNeill in <i>Irisleabhar na Gaedhilge</i>, May,
1908.<br />Pre-Ogam, before 300&nbsp;<span class="small">A.D.</span>
Ogam, c. 300(?)–700(?) <span class="small">A.D.</span><br />The Old
Irish of the MSS. from 600(?)–1000(?) <span class="small">A.D.</span><br
/>Middle Irish, 1000–1500 <span class="small">A.D.</span> Modern Irish,
1500–Present Day.<br /> During the present study we shall frequently use
the words Old Irish<br />to connote the Period including the 7th, 8th,

href="#FNanchor_476">[476]</a> The Vernacular Studies would naturally be
confined chiefly to the schools situated in Ireland. It is possible that
they were taught in some of the schools in Scotland and in those schools
on the Continent which had Irish pupils. It might be remarked that some
writers attribute the early literary development of vernacular poetry in
Northern England to the example set by the Irish monks in using their
native tongue for poetry.</p>

<p class="fnote"><a id="Footnote_477"></a><a
href="#FNanchor_477">[477]</a> Perhaps Clement, the successor of Alcuin
at the Palace School, should also be ranked as one of the greatest Irish
scholars. It is well known that he was a famous Greek scholar and is
believed by many to have been a much greater scholar than Alcuin, his
rival in royal favour. We have not yet succeeded in collecting
sufficient evidence to warrant his inclusion in the present
connection.</p>
